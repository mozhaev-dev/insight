## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

The Claude Enterprise connector extracts per-user daily activity, organization-wide summaries, chat project usage, and skill/connector adoption from five Anthropic Enterprise Analytics API endpoints and delivers them to the Bronze layer of the Insight platform. The connector is implemented as an Airbyte declarative manifest — a YAML file that defines all streams, authentication, pagination, incremental sync, and schemas without code. Silver staging is in scope: two dbt models (`claude_enterprise__ai_dev_usage`, `claude_enterprise__ai_assistant_usage`) transform Bronze into `class_ai_dev_usage` and `class_ai_assistant_usage`. Gold transformations are out of scope for this connector iteration.

The connector defines five data streams:

1. **`claude_enterprise_users`** — per-user-per-day engagement metrics via `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/users` (incremental, date-based)
2. **`claude_enterprise_summaries`** — daily organization summary via `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/summaries` (incremental, date-based, multi-day response)
3. **`claude_enterprise_chat_projects`** — per-project-per-day chat activity via `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/apps/chat/projects` (incremental)
4. **`claude_enterprise_skills`** — per-skill-per-day adoption via `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/skills` (incremental)
5. **`claude_enterprise_connectors`** — per-connector-per-day adoption via `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/connectors` (incremental)

A sixth Bronze table (`claude_enterprise_collection_runs`) is documented in §3.7 for operational monitoring but is **not emitted by the Airbyte manifest** — it is produced by the Argo orchestrator pipeline (see PRD §5.6 deferral note).

All per-user data flows through `user_email` (in `users`) and `created_by_email` (in `chat_projects`) as identity keys. Aggregate streams (`summaries`, `skills`, `connectors`) do not carry per-user identity. The orchestrator-produced `collection_runs` table does not carry any user identity.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

**PRD**: [PRD.md](./PRD.md)

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-users-collect` | Stream `claude_enterprise_users` → `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/users` (incremental, cursor-paginated per day) |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-users-incremental` | `DatetimeBasedCursor` on `date`; `step: P1D`; one request per day |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-summaries-collect` | Stream `claude_enterprise_summaries` → `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/summaries` (incremental, multi-day response) |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-summaries-chunking` | `DatetimeBasedCursor` with `step: P1D` and `starting_date` only (no `ending_date`). The API supports 31-day ranges, but `ending_date` is exclusive — using P31D with Airbyte's inclusive cursor arithmetic causes boundary-day loss. P1D avoids this safely. |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-projects-collect` | Stream `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` → `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/apps/chat/projects` (incremental) |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-projects-incremental` | `DatetimeBasedCursor` on `date`; `step: P1D` |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-skills-collect` | Stream `claude_enterprise_skills` → `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/skills` (incremental) |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-skills-incremental` | `DatetimeBasedCursor` on `date`; `step: P1D` |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-connectors-collect` | Stream `claude_enterprise_connectors` → `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/connectors` (incremental) |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-connectors-incremental` | `DatetimeBasedCursor` on `date`; `step: P1D` |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-collection-runs` | Stream `claude_enterprise_collection_runs` — connector execution log |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-min-date-enforcement` | `start_datetime.min_datetime = 2026-01-01`; configured `start_date` clamped to this floor |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-reporting-lag` | `end_datetime = now_utc() - 3 days`; requests beyond this upper bound are deferred |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-deduplication` | Primary keys: `unique_key` (users/chat_projects/skills/connectors), `date` (summaries), `run_id` (collection_runs) |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-tenant-tagging` | `AddFields` transformation injects `tenant_id`, `insight_source_id`, `data_source`, `collected_at` on every record |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-identity-key` | `user_email` in `claude_enterprise_users`; `created_by_email` in `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-claude-enterprise-identity-email-only` | Anthropic `user.id` and `created_by.id` retained but not marked as identity keys |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR ID | NFR Summary | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification Approach |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `cpt-insightspec-nfr-claude-enterprise-freshness` | Bronze data for day D available by end of D+4 | Orchestrator scheduling | Daily scheduled run; cursor starts from last sync position; upper bound = today−3 | Compare latest `date` in Bronze with `today() - 4` |
| `cpt-insightspec-nfr-claude-enterprise-completeness` | 100% extraction per stream per run | Pagination | All paginated endpoints use `CursorPagination` until `next_page` is null | Compare record count with API pagination metadata |
| `cpt-insightspec-nfr-claude-enterprise-schema-stability` | No unannounced breaking changes | Manifest schema | Inline schema definitions; additive changes non-breaking | Schema diff on version updates |

#### Architecture Decision Records

The Enterprise Analytics API is new enough that no project-specific ADRs have been authored yet. Open design questions are captured in §13 of the PRD and in [Open Questions](#open-questions) below. When decisions are made (for example, on volume sizing or Office/Cowork mapping), they will be captured as ADRs under `specs/ADR/`.

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### One Stream per Endpoint

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-claude-enterprise-one-stream-per-endpoint`

Each Enterprise Analytics API endpoint maps to exactly one stream. This preserves the API's data model without transformation and keeps each stream independently configurable, retryable, and deduplicable.

#### Source-Native Schema with Selective Flattening

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-claude-enterprise-source-native-schema`

Bronze tables preserve the original Enterprise Analytics API field names where possible. Nested objects (`user`, `chat_metrics`, `claude_code_metrics`, `office_metrics`, `cowork_metrics`, `created_by`) are **selectively flattened**: headline counters (message counts, commit counts, session counts, etc.) become top-level columns for easy querying, and the full nested object is also preserved as a JSON blob (`{group}_json`) for forward compatibility. Framework fields (`tenant_id`, `insight_source_id`, `collected_at`, `data_source`) are injected via `AddFields`.

#### Email as the Sole Cross-System Identity Key

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-claude-enterprise-email-identity`

`user_email` (from `/users`) and `created_by_email` (from chat projects) are the only fields treated as cross-system identity keys. Anthropic's `user.id` / `created_by.id` are retained in Bronze for debugging but are not consumed downstream for person resolution.

#### Bronze + Silver Staging Scope

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-claude-enterprise-bronze-silver-staging`

This connector delivers Bronze tables, tenant tagging, and two Silver staging models that route Bronze → `class_ai_dev_usage` (Claude Code activity) and Bronze → `class_ai_assistant_usage` (chat / cowork / office / cross). The `descriptor.yaml` uses `dbt_select: "tag:claude-enterprise+"` to pick up both staging models via their `silver:class_*` tags. `silver_targets` is prohibited per Connector Spec §4.10 — Silver routing is determined by the dbt tag selector, not declared inline. Gold aggregations remain out of scope.

### 2.2 Constraints

#### API Key Authentication with Read-Analytics Scope

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-api-key-auth`

The Enterprise Analytics API uses API key authentication via the `x-api-key` header. The key must be created at `claude.ai/analytics/api-keys` by a Primary Owner and must carry the `read:analytics` scope. Every request also includes `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` for consistency with other Anthropic APIs (the header is not documented as required but is tolerated). Requests with a missing or wrong-scope key return HTTP 404; the connector surfaces this as an authentication failure.

#### All Endpoints are GET with Date Parameters

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-get-endpoints`

All five endpoints use HTTP GET with query parameters. `/users`, `/apps/chat/projects`, `/skills`, `/connectors` accept a single `date` parameter (YYYY-MM-DD). `/summaries` accepts `starting_date` and optional `ending_date` (exclusive). There are no POST endpoints and no request bodies.

#### Cursor-Based Pagination

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-cursor-pagination`

`/users`, `/apps/chat/projects`, `/skills`, `/connectors` all use cursor pagination: clients pass an opaque `page` token (from the previous response's `next_page`) and receive records in `data`. Pagination stops when `next_page` is absent or null. The manifest uses `CursorPagination` for these streams. `/summaries` is called once per day (P1D step, `starting_date` only) and returns a single day's summary without pagination.

#### 31-Day Maximum Range on Summaries

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-summaries-window`

The `/summaries` endpoint rejects requests where `ending_date - starting_date > 31 days` with HTTP 400. The manifest uses `step: P1D` with only `starting_date` (no `ending_date`) to avoid boundary-day data loss caused by the API's exclusive `ending_date` semantics. Each request returns one day's summary.

#### Three-Day Reporting Lag

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-reporting-lag`

The API makes data for day `N-1` queryable only starting on day `N+2` (i.e., three full days after aggregation). Requests for dates within the lag window return HTTP 400. The manifest's `DatetimeBasedCursor` sets `end_datetime` to `now_utc() - 3 days`, truncated to day boundary. Dates beyond this upper bound are deferred to the next run.

#### Minimum Queryable Date (2026-01-01)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-min-date`

The API rejects any date earlier than 2026-01-01 with HTTP 400. The manifest enforces this with `MinMaxDatetime.min_datetime = "2026-01-01"`, which silently clamps any earlier `start_date` to the minimum. The clamp is logged on first run.

#### Configurable Base URL

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-base-url-override`

The manifest's `url_base` is resolved from the connector config (`base_url` parameter, default `https://api.anthropic.com`). This lets operators point the connector at a local stub during development without changing the manifest. Production deployments must leave the default in place.

#### Rate Limits Honoured via DefaultErrorHandler

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-claude-enterprise-rate-limits`

The API enforces organization-level rate limits (default values are not documented and are adjustable with Anthropic CSM). The manifest uses `DefaultErrorHandler` with a `WaitTimeFromHeader` backoff on `Retry-After` and a `HttpResponseFilter` that retries on HTTP 429 and 503 and fails on 401/404. No custom throttling is implemented.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `UserActivity` | One user's daily engagement across Claude products. Key: composite `(date, user.id)`. Contains chat, Claude Code, Office, and Cowork metric groups and `web_search_count`. |
| `OrgSummary` | One day's organization-wide engagement snapshot. Key: `date`. Contains DAU/WAU/MAU, seat counts, and Cowork active-user counts. |
| `ChatProject` | One chat project's daily activity. Key: composite `(date, project_id)`. Contains user/conversation/message counts and ownership. |
| `SkillAdoption` | One skill's daily adoption. Key: composite `(date, skill_name)`. Contains distinct user count and per-surface session/conversation counts. |
| `ConnectorAdoption` | One MCP connector's daily adoption. Key: composite `(date, connector_name)`. Contains distinct user count and per-surface session/conversation counts. |
| `CollectionRun` | One connector execution. Key: `run_id`. Contains timestamps, per-stream counts, API call count, error count. |

**Relationships**:

- `UserActivity` → provides `user_email` → identity key for cross-system resolution
- `ChatProject.created_by_email` → identity key for project ownership
- `OrgSummary`, `SkillAdoption`, `ConnectorAdoption` → aggregated across users; carry no per-user identity
- All user-facing entities → `email` → resolved to `person_id` by Identity Manager (Silver, out of scope for this connector)

**Schema format**: Airbyte declarative manifest YAML with inline JSON Schema definitions per stream.
**Schema location**: `src/ingestion/connectors/ai/claude-enterprise/connector.yaml`.

### 3.2 Component Model

The Claude Enterprise connector is a single declarative manifest that defines five data streams. There are no custom code components.

    S2 -->|"data[]"| Dest
    S3 -->|"data[]"| Dest
    S4 -->|"data[]"| Dest
    S5 -->|"data[]"| Dest
```

#### Connector Package Structure

The Claude Enterprise connector is packaged as a self-contained unit following the standard connector package layout:

```text
src/ingestion/connectors/ai/claude-enterprise/
+-- connector.yaml          # Airbyte declarative manifest (nocode)
+-- descriptor.yaml         # Package metadata: schedule, dbt_select
+-- dbt/
    +-- claude_enterprise__ai_dev_usage.sql        # Bronze → class_ai_dev_usage
    +-- claude_enterprise__ai_assistant_usage.sql  # Bronze → class_ai_assistant_usage
    +-- schema.yml
```

#### Connector Package Descriptor

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-component-claude-enterprise-descriptor`

The `descriptor.yaml` registers the connector package with the platform. `silver_targets` is prohibited per Connector Spec §4.10 — Silver routing is determined by the dbt tag selector:

```yaml
name: claude-enterprise
version: "1.0"

schedule: "0 11 * * *"   # daily at 11:00 UTC

# Silver routing: tag:claude-enterprise+ picks up both staging models:
#   claude_enterprise__ai_dev_usage   (tag: silver:class_ai_dev_usage)
#   claude_enterprise__ai_assistant_usage (tag: silver:class_ai_assistant_usage)
dbt_select: "tag:claude-enterprise+"
```

#### Claude Enterprise Connector Manifest

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-component-claude-enterprise-manifest`

##### Why this component exists

Defines the complete Claude Enterprise connector as a YAML declarative manifest executed by the Airbyte Declarative Connector framework. No code required.

##### Responsibility scope

Defines all 5 data streams with: Enterprise Analytics API endpoint paths, API key authentication with `read:analytics` scope, cursor-based pagination, date-range-based incremental sync with reporting-lag upper bound and 2026-01-01 floor, summary range chunking, and inline JSON schemas.

##### Manifest Skeleton

The manifest uses Airbyte declarative framework v7.0.4. Key structural patterns (authoritative source: `src/ingestion/connectors/ai/claude-enterprise/connector.yaml`):

- **Auth**: `definitions.linked.HttpRequester.authenticator` — `ApiKeyAuthenticator` with `x-api-key` header + `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`
- **Error handling**: `definitions.retryable_error_handler` (NOT under `linked` — per create.md §3.1) — `CompositeErrorHandler` with 429 RATE_LIMITED + Retry-After, 5xx RETRY + exponential backoff, 401/404 FAIL
- **Pagination**: `definitions.linked.SimpleRetriever.paginator` — `CursorPagination` on `next_page` token (used by users, chat_projects, skills, connectors; summaries uses `NoPagination`)
- **Cursor**: `DatetimeBasedCursor` on `date` field, `min_datetime: "2026-01-01"`, `end_datetime: day_delta(-3)`, step P1D (all streams including summaries)
- **Transformations**: `AddFields` with `type: AddedFieldDefinition` per field — injects `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `data_source`, `collected_at`, `unique_key` + stream-specific flattened fields
- **Check**: `claude_enterprise_summaries` (lightest stream)
- **Base URL**: `{{ config.get('base_url', 'https://api.anthropic.com') }}` — overridable for dev/test
- **Spec**: `insight_tenant_id` + `insight_source_id` (required), `analytics_api_key` (required, airbyte_secret), `start_date` + `base_url` (optional)

##### Responsibility boundaries

Orchestration, scheduling, and state storage are handled by the Airbyte platform. Silver staging (two dbt models in `dbt/`) is in scope; Gold transformations, destination-specific configuration, and mock/stub services are out of scope.

##### Related components (by ID)

- Airbyte Declarative Connector framework (`source-declarative-manifest` image) — executes this manifest
- `cpt-insightspec-component-claude-enterprise-descriptor` — package metadata

#### tenant_id Injection Component

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-component-claude-enterprise-tenant-id-injection`

Ensures every record emitted by all streams contains `tenant_id`, `insight_source_id`, `data_source`, and `collected_at`. Implemented as an `AddFields` transformation in the manifest, applied to every stream.

### 3.3 API Contracts

#### Anthropic Enterprise Analytics API Endpoints

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-interface-claude-enterprise-api-endpoints`

- **Contracts**: `cpt-insightspec-contract-claude-enterprise-analytics-api`
- **Technology**: REST / JSON

| Stream | Endpoint | Pagination | Date Params |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `claude_enterprise_users` | `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/users` | Cursor: `page` param (from response `next_page`), default `limit=20`, max `1000` | Query: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `claude_enterprise_summaries` | `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/summaries` | None | Query: `starting_date` only (P1D step — no `ending_date` sent; API returns single day) |
| `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` | `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/apps/chat/projects` | Cursor: `page` param, default `limit=100`, max `1000` | Query: `date` |
| `claude_enterprise_skills` | `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/skills` | Cursor: `page` param, default `limit=100`, max `1000` | Query: `date` |
| `claude_enterprise_connectors` | `GET /v1/organizations/analytics/connectors` | Cursor: `page` param, default `limit=100`, max `1000` | Query: `date` |

**Response structure**:

| Stream | Response root | Records path |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| `claude_enterprise_users` | `{data: [...], next_page: string\|null}` | `data` |
| `claude_enterprise_summaries` | `{data: [...]}` | `data` |
| `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` | `{data: [...], next_page: string\|null}` | `data` |
| `claude_enterprise_skills` | `{data: [...], next_page: string\|null}` | `data` |
| `claude_enterprise_connectors` | `{data: [...], next_page: string\|null}` | `data` |

**Error handling**:

| HTTP code | Meaning | Connector response |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| 200 | Success | Emit records |
| 400 | Invalid query parameter (bad date, future date, pre-2026 date, range > 31 days) | Fail stream; operator reviews `start_date` / `end_date` / range logic |
| 404 | Missing/invalid key or missing `read:analytics` scope | Fail (authentication error) |
| 429 | Rate limited | Retry with `Retry-After` backoff |
| 503 | Transient failure | Retry with backoff |

**Authentication**:

- Header: `x-api-key: {analytics_api_key}`
- Required scope: `read:analytics`
- Sent alongside: `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`
- Manifest: `ApiKeyAuthenticator` with `header: x-api-key`, plus `request_headers` for the version header

#### Source Config Schema

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-interface-claude-enterprise-source-config`

The source config for the Claude Enterprise connector:

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "Tenant isolation identifier (UUID)",
  "analytics_api_key": "Enterprise Analytics API key with read:analytics scope",
  "insight_source_id": "Optional connector instance identifier",
  "start_date": "Optional earliest date to collect from (YYYY-MM-DD), default: 14 days ago; clamped to 2026-01-01",
  "base_url": "Optional API base URL override for development, default: https://api.anthropic.com"
}
```

`tenant_id` and `analytics_api_key` are required. `analytics_api_key` is marked `airbyte_secret: true` — it is never logged or displayed. `base_url` defaults to production Anthropic; production deployments must leave the default in place.

**Description**: The connector first computes the effective upper bound of the sync window (`today() - 3 days`) and clamps the lower bound to `max(configured start_date, 2026-01-01, last stored cursor)`. For `/users`, `/apps/chat/projects`, `/skills`, `/connectors` it iterates day-by-day and paginates each day to exhaustion. For `/summaries` it also walks day-by-day (P1D step, `starting_date` only — no `ending_date` sent) to avoid data loss from the API's exclusive end-date semantics. All five streams share the same cursor/lag semantics. After all streams complete, per-stream cursor state is persisted.

### 3.7 Database schemas & tables

Bronze tables are created by the destination (ClickHouse). In addition to the connector-defined columns listed below, the destination automatically adds framework columns to every table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `_airbyte_raw_id` | String | Airbyte deduplication key — auto-generated |
| `_airbyte_extracted_at` | DateTime64 | Extraction timestamp — auto-generated |

These columns are not defined in the manifest schema but are present in all Bronze tables at runtime.

Monitoring table — not an analytics source.

#### Destination Ordering, Partitioning, and Migration

**Recommended ClickHouse physical layout** (the destination operator owns the final choice; these are the defaults DESIGN assumes for reasoning about performance and storage):

| Table | Suggested `ORDER BY` | Suggested `PARTITION BY` |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `claude_enterprise_users` | `(tenant_id, date, user_id)` | `toYYYYMM(toDate(date))` |
| `claude_enterprise_summaries` | `(tenant_id, date)` | `toYYYYMM(toDate(date))` |
| `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` | `(tenant_id, date, project_id)` | `toYYYYMM(toDate(date))` |
| `claude_enterprise_skills` | `(tenant_id, date, skill_name)` | `toYYYYMM(toDate(date))` |
| `claude_enterprise_connectors` | `(tenant_id, date, connector_name)` | `toYYYYMM(toDate(date))` |
| `claude_enterprise_collection_runs` | `(tenant_id, started_at)` | `toYYYYMM(started_at)` |

**Typical Silver query patterns** (for downstream sizing and index planning):

- **Per-person daily roll-up**: `SELECT ... FROM claude_enterprise_users WHERE tenant_id = X AND date BETWEEN ... GROUP BY user_email, date` — served efficiently by the ordering above.
- **Org-level trend**: `SELECT ... FROM claude_enterprise_summaries WHERE tenant_id = X AND date BETWEEN ...` — single-table scan over a date range.
- **Skill/connector adoption**: `SELECT ... FROM claude_enterprise_skills WHERE tenant_id = X AND date = Y` — point lookup by partition.
- **Project ownership join**: `claude_enterprise_chat_projects.created_by_email` → Identity Manager → `person_id` → cross-source joins.

**Schema migration strategy**:

- **Additive changes** (new flattened columns, new `*_json` groups when the API adds surfaces) propagate automatically via Airbyte schema evolution. The NFR `cpt-insightspec-nfr-claude-enterprise-schema-stability` commits to additive-only behaviour by default.
- **Renames and removals** are breaking and require a versioned table (e.g., `claude_enterprise_users_v2`) with a migration bridge. The connector manifest increments its `version` in `descriptor.yaml` to signal the break.
- **Nested structure preserved**: `*_json` columns (e.g., `chat_metrics_json`) retain the full API response per group, so future field additions are recoverable from Bronze even before the manifest is updated to flatten them.

### 3.8 Deployment Topology

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-topology-claude-enterprise-connector`

The Claude Enterprise connector uses one manifest and one Airbyte connection (daily schedule):

```text
Package: src/ingestion/connectors/ai/claude-enterprise/
+-- connector.yaml (declarative manifest — 6 streams)
+-- descriptor.yaml (package metadata — dbt_select: "tag:claude-enterprise+")

Connection: claude-enterprise-{org_name}-daily
+-- Schedule: daily (via orchestrator cron)
+-- Source image: airbyte/source-declarative-manifest
+-- Source config: {tenant_id, analytics_api_key, start_date?, base_url?, insight_source_id?}
+-- Streams: claude_enterprise_users, claude_enterprise_summaries,
|            claude_enterprise_chat_projects, claude_enterprise_skills,
|            claude_enterprise_connectors, claude_enterprise_collection_runs
+-- Destination: ClickHouse (Bronze)
+-- State: per-stream date cursors
```

## 4. Additional context

### Identity Resolution Strategy

`user_email` (in `claude_enterprise_users`) and `created_by_email` (in `claude_enterprise_chat_projects`) are the identity keys. The Identity Manager resolves `email` → canonical `person_id` in Silver step 2 (out of scope for this connector). Anthropic's `user.id` / `created_by.id` are retained for debugging but are not used for cross-system resolution.

**Cross-platform note**: The same user can appear in the Admin API connector (future `claude-admin`) and in this Enterprise Analytics connector. Both sources use `email` as the identity key, so cross-source joins at `person_id` work without additional mapping.

Aggregate streams (`summaries`, `skills`, `connectors`) carry no per-user identity — they are already aggregated by the API.

### Data Ownership & Lineage

**Ownership** (per PRD §11 Assumptions):

- **Controller**: the deploying organization — responsible for lawful basis, consent, and data-subject rights for the personal data (`user_email`, `created_by_email`) collected by the connector
- **Processor — upstream**: Anthropic — processes the organization's data to produce the Enterprise Analytics API responses
- **Joint processors — downstream**: the Airbyte platform and the destination operator — process Bronze rows on behalf of the controller

**Lineage**:

```text
api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/analytics/*   (source)
    │
    └─► source-declarative-manifest container    (Airbyte extraction, AddFields injection)
            │
            └─► destination connector             (ClickHouse / PostgreSQL)
                    │
                    └─► Bronze tables (claude_enterprise_*)
```

Every Bronze row carries `collected_at` (timestamp of extraction) and `insight_source_id` (instance discriminator), enabling tie-back to a specific `claude_enterprise_collection_runs` record for full provenance. `tenant_id` on every row provides the multi-tenant partitioning key. Retention, erasure, and cross-border transfer controls are delegated to the destination operator and out of scope for this connector.

### Silver / Gold Mappings

This connector ships two Silver staging models. Both read from `bronze_claude_enterprise.claude_enterprise_users` and are picked up by `dbt_select: "tag:claude-enterprise+"` via their `silver:class_*` tags.

#### `claude_enterprise__ai_dev_usage` → `class_ai_dev_usage` (`tool='claude_code'`)

Per the cross-vendor source-resolution rule, Enterprise is the canonical Code feed for orgs on the Enterprise subscription. Claude Admin's `claude_admin__ai_dev_usage` is left untagged for `class_ai_dev_usage` to avoid double-counting (Admin still feeds `class_ai_api_usage` for token-level metering, which Enterprise does not expose).

| Bronze field | Silver column | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `code_session_count` | `session_count` | |
| `code_lines_added` | `lines_added` | AI-accepted lines only |
| `code_lines_removed` | `lines_removed` | |
| — | `total_lines_added` / `total_lines_removed` | NULL — Enterprise does not expose total keystrokes; only Cursor does |
| `code_tool_accepted_count + code_tool_rejected_count` | `tool_use_offered` | |
| `code_tool_accepted_count` | `tool_use_accepted` / `completions_count` | Edit / Write / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit invocations |
| `code_commit_count` | `commits_count` | Git commits attributed to Claude Code sessions |
| `code_pull_request_count` | `pull_requests_count` | |
| `claude_code_metrics_json` | `tool_action_breakdown_json` | Full per-tool breakdown stored as-is for downstream analytics |
| — | `agent_sessions`, `chat_requests`, `cost_cents` | NULL — Enterprise has no Code-specific agent / chat counters; cost is org-level, not per-user |

Filter: emit row only when `code_session_count > 0 OR code_lines_added > 0 OR code_tool_accepted_count > 0`.

#### `claude_enterprise__ai_assistant_usage` → `class_ai_assistant_usage` (`tool='claude'`, `surface ∈ {chat, excel, powerpoint, cowork, cross}`)

All rows carry `tool='claude'` (vendor discriminator on the Silver class). Future providers — OpenAI Compliance API for ChatGPT, Google for Gemini — will write to the same Silver class with `tool='chatgpt'` / `'gemini'`.

One Bronze row per `(date, user_email)` produces up to five staging rows — one per non-empty surface.

| Surface | Filter (any > 0 emits a row) | Primary fields populated |
|---|---|---|
| `chat` | `chat_conversation_count`, `chat_message_count`, `chat_files_uploaded_count`, `chat_artifacts_created_count`, `chat_projects_created_count`, `chat_projects_used_count`, `chat_skills_used_count`, `chat_connectors_used_count`, `chat_thinking_message_count` | `conversation_count`, `message_count`, `files_uploaded_count`, `artifacts_created_count`, `projects_*`, `skills_used_count`, `connectors_used_count`, `thinking_message_count`, `surface_metrics_json` |
| `excel` | `excel_session_count`, `excel_message_count` | `session_count`, `message_count`, `surface_metrics_json` (full office_metrics_json) |
| `powerpoint` | `powerpoint_session_count`, `powerpoint_message_count` | `session_count`, `message_count`, `surface_metrics_json` (full office_metrics_json) |
| `cowork` | `cowork_session_count`, `cowork_message_count`, `cowork_action_count`, `cowork_dispatch_turn_count`, `cowork_skills_used_count` | `session_count`, `message_count`, `action_count`, `dispatch_turn_count`, `skills_used_count`, `surface_metrics_json` |
| `cross` | `web_search_count` | `search_count` only (all other counters NULL, `surface_metrics_json` NULL) |

`cost_cents` is always NULL for Enterprise — cost is org-level subscription, not per-user / per-surface. Column is reserved on the Silver schema for future providers that surface assistant cost per user.

`web_search_count` is routed to a dedicated `surface='cross'` row rather than attached to `chat`. Web search is not session-bound to any single surface; emitting it standalone keeps surface-specific schemas clean and lets gold consumers attribute search activity without picking arbitrary buckets.

#### Other Bronze tables — not yet routed to Silver

| Bronze table | Status |
|---|---|
| `claude_enterprise_summaries` | Org-level rollup; consumer not yet defined |
| `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` | Catalog metadata; future `class_ai_directories` candidate |
| `claude_enterprise_skills` | Catalog metadata; future `class_ai_directories` candidate |
| `claude_enterprise_connectors` | Catalog metadata; future `class_ai_directories` candidate |
| `claude_enterprise_collection_runs` | Operational monitoring only — not analytics |

### Incremental Sync Strategy

All five data streams use incremental sync on `date`:

| Stream | Cursor field | Step | First-run start | End |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------------|-----|
| `claude_enterprise_users` | `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) | `P1D` | `max(configured start_date, 2026-01-01)`; default 14 days ago | `now_utc() - 3 days` |
| `claude_enterprise_summaries` | `date` | `P1D` | Same | Same |
| `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` | `date` | `P1D` | Same | Same |
| `claude_enterprise_skills` | `date` | `P1D` | Same | Same |
| `claude_enterprise_connectors` | `date` | `P1D` | Same | Same |
| `claude_enterprise_collection_runs` | None (full refresh, append-only) | — | — | — |

**Why `P1D` for most streams**: Each endpoint returns all data for a single date, so per-day requests are the natural unit. Paginate within a day with cursor tokens; advance the date cursor after pagination completes.

**Why `P1D` for summaries (not `P31D`)**: The summaries endpoint supports multi-day ranges via `starting_date` + `ending_date`, but `ending_date` is **exclusive**. Airbyte's `DatetimeBasedCursor` computes inclusive-inclusive intervals (window_end = start + step - granularity), so using P31D causes the last day of each window to be silently skipped. P1D with `starting_date` only (no `ending_date`) avoids this boundary bug. Performance impact is minimal: one extra HTTP call per day for a tiny payload.

**Default start**: `day_delta(-14)` (14 days ago), not 90 as in the Admin API connector (`claude-admin`). Rationale: the minimum queryable date is 2026-01-01, the lag is 3 days, and per-user records are the largest stream — a shorter default keeps the first run fast.

### Reporting Lag & Minimum Date Handling

The manifest encodes both constraints in its `DatetimeBasedCursor`:

```yaml
incremental_sync:
  type: DatetimeBasedCursor
  cursor_field: date
  cursor_datetime_formats: ["%Y-%m-%d"]
  datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
  start_datetime:
    type: MinMaxDatetime
    datetime: "{{ config.get('start_date', day_delta(-14, format='%Y-%m-%d')) }}"
    datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
    min_datetime: "2026-01-01"    # <-- enforces min date
  end_datetime:
    type: MinMaxDatetime
    datetime: "{{ (now_utc() - duration('P3D')).strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}"    # <-- enforces lag
    datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%d"
  step: P1D
```

- **Minimum date**: any `start_date` earlier than 2026-01-01 is silently clamped by `MinMaxDatetime.min_datetime`. The `start_date` override is logged by the framework on first use.
- **Reporting lag**: `end_datetime` is dynamically computed as `today - 3 days` at the start of each run. Dates within the lag window are simply not requested; they show up on the next run.

Both are framework-native features — no custom validation code required.

### Base URL Override

The connector's `url_base` is a template expression: `{{ config.get('base_url', 'https://api.anthropic.com') }}`. Operators can override it via the `base_url` config field for local development against a stub service. In production, the default points at Anthropic.

Rationale: zero code paths differ between production and development. The connector sees a mock and the real API identically. The stub service itself is outside the scope of this connector (it is a separate dev aid and not part of the spec).

### Capacity Estimates

Expected data volumes for typical deployments (see `OQ-CE-5` for formal sizing):

| Stream | Volume per day | Estimated sync time (per day) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| `claude_enterprise_users` | ≤ 10,000 rows (one per seat active that day) | 10–60s depending on page count (default 20/page) |
| `claude_enterprise_summaries` | 1 row / day | < 1s per request |
| `claude_enterprise_chat_projects` | 10–500 rows | < 30s |
| `claude_enterprise_skills` | 10–200 rows | < 10s |
| `claude_enterprise_connectors` | 10–100 rows | < 10s |

First-run backfill of 14 days at ~10,000 seats: approximately 140,000 user-day rows plus smaller amounts for the other streams. Estimated first-run duration 5–20 minutes depending on API rate limits. Subsequent daily runs: 1–3 minutes.

**Cost**: Direct API cost is zero — the Enterprise Analytics API is included with the Enterprise seat fee paid by the deploying organization. There are no per-request charges or billable quotas at the connector level. Incremental cost drivers are:

- **Destination-side storage**: Bronze rows accumulate over time. For a 10,000-seat organization, the `users` stream alone adds ~10,000 rows/day × ~1 KB/row × 365 days ≈ 3.7 GB/year before compression. The other four streams contribute an order of magnitude less.
- **Orchestrator compute time**: see sync durations above.
- **Network egress** (if the destination is in a different region than the connector): negligible for the data volumes involved.

**Cost optimization**: The `start_date` default of 14 days keeps first-run cost low; operators needing deeper history set a longer backfill explicitly. Bronze retention and archival are delegated to the destination operator (see PRD §3.1).

### Open Questions

**OQ-CE-1: Backfill depth on first run** — Current default is 14 days ago. Is this enough for typical first-run deployments, or should it be longer (e.g., 30 or 90 days)? The PRD lists this as an open question for DESIGN; the conservative default prevents long first-run times for large organizations but may force a re-configure for teams wanting deeper history.

**OQ-CE-2: `project_id` format** — The API returns project IDs in the form `claude_proj_{id}`. Bronze preserves the verbatim format. Whether to parse/strip the prefix for Silver is deferred to Silver design.

**OQ-CE-3: Users stream vs summaries overlap** — Both streams report active-user counts (users can be aggregated; summaries report DAU/WAU/MAU directly). Silver will need to reconcile these. Open until Silver design.

**OQ-CE-4: Future surfaces** — If Anthropic exposes additional product surfaces (beyond Excel/PowerPoint Office agents), the connector will need to absorb them. The `{group}_metrics_json` columns preserve the raw structure so new fields are non-breaking, but explicit flattening would require a manifest update.

**OQ-CE-5: Volume ceiling per instance** — Informal guidance: ≤ 10,000 seats per instance. Larger organizations may require sharding (e.g., by workspace if/when the API exposes a workspace filter) or separate connector instances. To be resolved during early deployments.

### Addressed Domains

The following checklist domains are addressed in this DESIGN:

| Domain | Where addressed |
|--------|-----------------|
| ARCH (Architecture) | §1 Architecture Overview, §2 Principles & Constraints, §3 Technical Architecture |
| SEM (PRD/ADR Traceability) | §1.2 driver tables, §5 Traceability |
| DATA (Data Architecture & Governance) | §3.1 Domain Model, §3.7 Bronze tables + ordering/migration, §4 Data Ownership & Lineage |
| INT (Integration) | §3.3 API Contracts, §3.5 External Dependencies |
| BIZ (Business Alignment) | §1.2 driver tables |
| DOC (Non-Applicability) | §4 this section + next (Non-Applicable Domains) |

### Non-Applicable Domains

The following checklist domains have been evaluated and are not applicable for this connector:

| Domain | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **PERF (Performance)** | Batch data pipeline with native API pagination. Rate-limit handling via `DefaultErrorHandler` (documented in Constraints SS2.2) is the only performance-related concern. |
| **SEC (Security)** | Authentication is delegated to the Airbyte framework: the API key is stored as `airbyte_secret`, never logged or exposed. The declarative manifest contains no custom security logic. |
| **SAFE (Safety)** | Pure data-extraction pipeline. No interaction with physical systems. |
| **REL (Reliability)** | Idempotent extraction via deduplication keys. Recovery = re-run the sync; the Airbyte framework manages cursor state and retry. |
| **UX (Usability)** | No user-facing interface. Only UX surface is the Airbyte connection configuration form. |
| **MAINT (Maintainability)** | Declarative YAML manifest with no custom code. |
| **COMPL (Compliance)** | Personal data (work emails) is in scope; retention, deletion, and access controls are delegated to the Airbyte platform and destination operator. |
| **OPS (Operations)** | Deployed as a standard Airbyte connection — no custom infrastructure, no IaC. Topology documented in SS3.8; execution log in the `collection_runs` stream. |
| **TEST (Testing)** | Declarative connector validated by Airbyte framework checks (connection, schema) plus PRD §9 acceptance criteria. Stub-based dev testing is the operator's tool, not a design concern. |
