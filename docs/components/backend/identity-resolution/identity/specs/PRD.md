## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

`insight-identity` is a .NET 9 / ASP.NET Core minimal-API service that
serves person lookups over the multi-source observation log stored in
the MariaDB `persons` table. It owns its database (per ADR-0006),
applies its own DbUp migrations at startup, and exposes a small
read-only HTTP surface to api-gateway and internal workflows
(`GET /v1/persons/{email}`, `/health`, `/healthz`).

The service is the first synchronous consumer of the append-only
observation log seeded from `identity.identity_inputs`. It enriches
analytics responses with display names, supervisor links, and other
person attributes — without callers having to know which connector
provided each value.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

Identity-bearing data lands in Insight from multiple connectors —
BambooHR, Cursor, Claude Admin, Jira, Slack, MS Entra, and others. PR
#214 introduced an append-only `persons` observation log that unifies
every connector behind a single schema (one row per
`(insight_tenant_id, person_id, insight_source_type, insight_source_id,
value_type, value_hash)`). Until this service shipped, the only
synchronous consumer was a Rust stub that loaded BambooHR `employees`
into an in-memory `HashMap` at startup — single-source, restart-coupled
to the bronze snapshot, and unable to surface non-BambooHR observations.

The platform needs a synchronous lookup path that (a) sees every source
the seed pipeline writes, (b) returns live data without a pod restart,
(c) is tenant-safe by construction, and (d) follows the cyberfabric
ASP.NET Core / Serilog / RFC 7807 conventions established for other
.NET services in the platform.

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

- **Multi-source coverage.** Lookup answers correctly for any source
  whose connector emits identity observations — not only BambooHR.
- **Live data.** Updates that land in `persons` are visible without a
  pod restart; no in-memory full-table cache to invalidate.
- **Tenant safety.** Every query is scoped by `insight_tenant_id`; no
  cross-tenant data leak is possible by construction.
- **Operational predictability.** First-install behaviour is "every
  lookup returns 404 until the seed runs" — never a crash loop.

### 1.4 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| `persons` | The MariaDB append-only observation log; one row per (tenant, person_id, source_type, source_id, value_type, value_hash). Defined in `identity` DB. |
| `account_person_map` | SCD2 cache derived from `persons` rows where `value_type='id'`; maps source-account → `person_id` over time. |
| Observation | One row in `persons` — a single (`value_type`, `value`) datapoint emitted by one source for one person at one instant. Never updated; superseded by a newer observation with the same partition key. |
| `value_type` | Free-form `VARCHAR(50)` attribute name. Canonical set: `id`, `email`, `username`, `display_name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `department`, `division`, `job_title`, `status`, `employee_id`, `parent_email`, `parent_id`, `parent_person_id`. |
| `value_id` / `value_full_text` / `value` | Routing columns selected per `value_type` per ADR-0007. `id`/`email`/`username` → `value_id` (strict utf8mb4_bin); `display_name` → `value_full_text` (utf8mb4_unicode_ci); everything else → `value`. |
| `insight_tenant_id` | `BINARY(16)` tenant UUID; part of every query and every index. |
| Latest-per-source | The projection `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY source_type, source_id, value_type ORDER BY created_at DESC)` — picks the most recent observation per attribute per source. |
| Assembler | `PersonAssembler` — collapses latest-per-source rows into a single `PersonResponse` by picking the latest value across sources per `value_type`. |
| DbUp | The .NET migration library; tracks applied SQL scripts in a `SchemaVersions` table inside the service's own database. |
| Seed | The one-shot Bash + Python pipeline at `src/backend/services/identity/seed/` that materialises `persons` rows from ClickHouse `identity.identity_inputs`. Not a schema migration. |

## 2. Actors

### 2.1 Human Actors

#### Platform SRE

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-platform-sre`

**Role**: Operates the Insight install on a customer cluster. Runs
seed pipelines, reads `/health` and `/healthz` to determine pod
readiness, and triages 5xx responses from the service.

**Needs**: A deterministic health/readiness contract; structured logs
that name the failure mode without leaking PII; a clear error response
when the seed has not yet been run.

#### Connector Developer

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-identity-connector-dev`

**Role**: Adds new connectors that emit identity observations and
extends the `value_type` taxonomy. Validates that new attributes
surface correctly on the lookup response.

**Needs**: A stable contract for which `value_type`s are projected;
documented routing rules (ADR-0007); a way to extend the projection
without breaking existing callers.

### 2.2 System Actors

#### api-gateway

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`

**Role**: External-facing reverse proxy. Calls
`GET /v1/persons/{email}` to enrich analytics responses with
display-name, supervisor, and org-unit fields. Sends
`X-Insight-Tenant-Id` derived from the resolved JWT principal.

#### dbt-runner / Argo Workflows

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-identity-argo`

**Role**: Internal compute callers that may need person metadata when
materialising Gold tables or running ad-hoc reconciliations. Carry
the tenant context via the same header.

#### MariaDB

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-mariadb`

**Role**: Stores the `persons` and `account_person_map` tables that
the service reads and that DbUp migrates on startup. Connection
target named by `IDENTITY__mariadb__url`.

#### Seed pipeline

**ID**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-seed-pipeline`

**Role**: Writes observation rows into `persons` from ClickHouse
`identity.identity_inputs`. Runs out-of-band (operator-triggered);
the service does not orchestrate it. The reader trusts that any
visible row is well-formed per the routing rules in ADR-0007.

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

### 3.1 Module-Specific Environment Constraints

- **.NET 9 runtime.** Service binary is published as
  `linux/amd64` self-contained; Kubernetes pod runs as UID 1000
  non-root.
- **MariaDB reachability at startup.** DbUp connects, runs
  `EnsureDatabase`, applies migrations, then opens the HTTP listener.
  If MariaDB is unreachable, the pod crashes early — kubelet retries.
  There is no "start without DB and reconnect later" mode.
- **No in-memory cache.** Every lookup hits MariaDB. Memory budget
  (NFR-2) reflects the absence of cache, not its presence.
- **Tenant header mandatory in prod.** With `tenant_default_id`
  unset, every request must carry `X-Insight-Tenant-Id`. Dev / local
  clusters pin a default tenant in values; production overlays leave
  it empty (the validator in api-gateway derives it from the JWT
  principal before forwarding).

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

- `GET /v1/persons/{email}` returning a single `PersonResponse` with
  parent attributes (`parent_email`, `parent_id`, `parent_person_id`)
  but no recursive subordinate expansion.
- `GET /health` — DB ping (200 if reachable, 503 otherwise).
- `GET /healthz` — process liveness (200 `text/plain "ok"`).
- Tenant resolution by `X-Insight-Tenant-Id` header with optional
  fallback to `IDENTITY__identity__tenant_default_id` config.
- Lowercase-email lookup against `value_type = 'email'`.
- Display-name split fallback when explicit `first_name` /
  `last_name` observations are absent.
- DbUp-applied schema (`001_persons.sql`, `002_account_person_map.sql`)
  per ADR-0006.

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- Recursive subordinate expansion via `parent_person_id` (Phase 2).
- Real JWT-claim validation (Phase 2 — `JwtTenantContext` is wired in
  DI as a stub, returns `null`).
- Multi-result return shape with id-type filtering (Phase 2).
- Temporal "as-of" queries by date range (Phase 3).
- Writing observations into `persons` (owned by the seed pipeline
  and a future reconciliation service).
- Merge / split workflows on person identities.
- OIDC subject mapping, org_units, memberships, user_identities,
  user_roles tables — tracked separately under cyberfabric/cyber-insight#80.

## 5. Functional Requirements

> **Testing strategy**: All functional requirements verified via
> automated tests — unit tests cover domain logic (`PersonAssembler`,
> `DisplayNameSplitter`, `MariaDbConnectionFactory`); integration
> tests cover SQL + endpoint behaviour against a Testcontainers
> MariaDB.

### 5.1 Lookup contract

#### Resolve email to person_id

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-resolve-by-email`

The system **MUST** resolve a lowercased email to a single `person_id`
using the latest observation per
`(insight_source_type, insight_source_id, value_type, value_id)`
partition where `value_type = 'email'` and `insight_tenant_id` matches.

**Rationale**: Email is the lookup key used by every current caller;
"latest per source" matches the seed pipeline's semantics and avoids
returning stale post-merge identities.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`,
`cpt-insightspec-actor-argo-workflows`

#### Hydrate person attributes

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-hydrate`

The system **MUST** hydrate every other response field with the latest
observation per `(insight_source_type, insight_source_id, value_type)`
partition for the resolved `person_id`. The assembler **MUST** then
pick the per-`value_type` winner across sources by latest `created_at`.

**Rationale**: A single source can be authoritative for some fields
and silent on others; the assembler must compose the response from
multiple sources without preferring any one of them by default.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`

#### Not-found returns RFC 7807

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-404`

The system **MUST** return `404 Not Found` with an RFC 7807
problem-details body when no current observation matches the supplied
email + tenant.

**Rationale**: Empty-result is a normal first-install state, not an
error; callers must distinguish it from server failures.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`

#### Missing tenant returns RFC 7807

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-400-tenant`

The system **MUST** return `400 Bad Request` with an RFC 7807
problem-details body of type
`urn:insight:error:tenant_unresolved` when the request carries no
`X-Insight-Tenant-Id` header and no `tenant_default_id` is configured.

**Rationale**: Silently defaulting a tenant in a multi-tenant
deployment is a data-leak risk. The composite resolver lets the header
win; the default is opt-in for single-tenant clusters.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-platform-sre`

#### Surface parent attributes when present

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-parent`

The system **MUST** surface `parent_email`, `parent_id`, and
`parent_person_id` on the response when those `value_type`s exist for
the resolved person.

**Rationale**: Org-tree consumers need the supervisor edge today even
though recursive expansion is Phase 2; surfacing the raw observations
unblocks them without coupling to the reconciliation service.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`

### 5.2 Routing and normalisation

#### Lowercase email at the boundary

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-routing-lowercase`

The system **MUST** lowercase the email before lookup; storage and
lookup share the `utf8mb4_bin` collation on `value_id` so the
byte-identical lowercased form is required for an index hit.

**Rationale**: Producers vary on email case; without lowercasing at
read time we miss matches. Storage stays in the original case for
audit, but the lookup index is over the lowercased form.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`

#### Display-name split fallback

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-routing-name-split`

The system **MUST** fall back to splitting `display_name` into
`first_name` / `last_name` when neither explicit observation is
present, using the rules in ADR-0006 (`"Last, First"` vs
`"First Last"`).

**Rationale**: BambooHR's older snapshot lacked dedicated first/last
fields; the split keeps the response shape complete without forcing
a connector backfill.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`

### 5.3 Schema lifecycle

#### Service-owned migrations at startup

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-migrations-startup`

The service **MUST** apply its own DbUp migrations (plain SQL files
under `Insight.Identity.Infrastructure/Migrations/`) against the
configured MariaDB before opening the HTTP listener. Migration history
**MUST** be tracked in a `SchemaVersions` table inside the service's
own database.

**Rationale**: Per ADR-0006 each service owns its schema; serial
startup ordering prevents requests from ever hitting an unmigrated
table.

**Actors**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-mariadb`, `cpt-insightspec-actor-platform-sre`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 NFR Inclusions

#### P95 lookup latency

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-latency`

The system **MUST** answer `GET /v1/persons/{email}` within
**50 ms p95** for tenants with under 50 000 persons.

**Threshold**: p95 ≤ 50 ms measured at the api-gateway → identity
hop; tenants with > 50 000 persons fall under the project default
(p95 ≤ 200 ms).

**Rationale**: Single-row cardinality on a covered index
(`idx_value_id`) makes this achievable without caching; the bound is
tight to keep gateway-side timeouts conservative.

#### Memory budget without caching

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-memory`

The system **MUST** stay under **384 MiB RSS** at steady state with
zero in-memory full-table cache.

**Threshold**: RSS ≤ 384 MiB across a 24 h soak with 100 RPS mixed
hot/cold reads against a 50 000-row dataset.

**Rationale**: Architecture decision (ADR-0002): no in-memory cache,
every read hits MariaDB; the memory budget reflects that.

#### Structured JSON logs with PII redaction

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-logging-pii`

The system **MUST** emit structured JSON logs via Serilog
`CompactJsonFormatter` with the enricher `service=identity`.
Request-logging middleware **MUST** record only an allow-listed
property set (`RequestMethod`, `RequestPath` template, `StatusCode`,
`Elapsed`, `RequestId`, `ConnectionId`, `@tr`/`@sp` trace+span IDs)
and **MUST** redact the raw email path segment to
`/v1/persons/<redacted>`. Unhandled-exception payloads **MUST**
include exception type + message + sanitised `db_target`
(`host:port/db`, no credentials) and **MUST NOT** include the
connection string.

**Threshold**: Manual log-scrape audit shows zero raw emails in
captured request paths across the test suite.

**Rationale**: Emails are PII; the URL template carries the customer's
mailbox locally — leaking it into log aggregation would breach the
project-wide PII handling policy.

#### `BINARY(16)` UUID round-trip

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-uuid-roundtrip`

All UUIDs (`insight_tenant_id`, `insight_source_id`, `person_id`,
`author_person_id`) **MUST** round-trip as `BINARY(16)` via
`Guid.ToByteArray()` / `new Guid(byte[])`. The repository
**MUST NOT** rely on MySqlConnector's default `ToString()` fallback,
which produces a 36-char form that the `BINARY(16)` column silently
truncates to 16 ASCII bytes.

**Threshold**: An integration test seeds a row by bytes and reads it
back by Guid; equality holds byte-for-byte.

**Rationale**: The truncation bug was caught in the Python seeder and
is the canonical UUID-handling failure mode for MariaDB clients;
this NFR forces the explicit bytes binding everywhere.

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

- **High availability via in-memory replication**: not applicable —
  the service is stateless beyond its connection pool; HA is
  addressed by Kubernetes `replicaCount` and MariaDB's own
  replication, not by service-level state replication.
- **Write throughput SLO**: not applicable — service is read-only;
  write paths (seed, reconciliation) carry their own SLOs.

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

### 7.1 Public API Surface

#### `GET /v1/persons/{email}` — Person lookup

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-interface-identity-person-lookup`

**Type**: HTTP/REST endpoint.

**Stability**: stable for Phase 1 contract; Phase 2 will add a POST
counterpart accepting `{id, id_type}` without breaking this GET.

**Description**: Resolves `{email}` (lowercased) to a single
`PersonResponse` JSON body. Tenant supplied via
`X-Insight-Tenant-Id` header (preferred) or config default.
Returns 200 + body on hit, 404 + RFC 7807 on miss, 400 + RFC 7807
on missing tenant, 5xx on service error.

**Breaking Change Policy**: Major version bump for response-shape
changes; additive fields are non-breaking; the URL template is
stable across minor versions.

#### `GET /health` — Database readiness

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-interface-identity-health`

**Type**: HTTP/REST endpoint.

**Stability**: stable.

**Description**: Pings MariaDB. Returns 200 when the pool is
healthy, 503 otherwise. Wired as the Helm readiness probe.

**Breaking Change Policy**: No payload shape — never breaking.

#### `GET /healthz` — Process liveness

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-interface-identity-healthz`

**Type**: HTTP/REST endpoint.

**Stability**: stable.

**Description**: Returns 200 `text/plain "ok"` if the process is up;
does not touch MariaDB. Wired as the Helm liveness probe.

**Breaking Change Policy**: No payload shape — never breaking.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

#### `IDENTITY__*` env-var contract

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-contract-identity-env-config`

**Direction**: required from operator (Helm umbrella or BYO Secret).

**Protocol/Format**: ASP.NET Core configuration with double-underscore
section delimiter (`IDENTITY__mariadb__url`,
`IDENTITY__identity__tenant_default_id`, etc.). YAML overlay supported
via `appsettings.yaml`.

**Compatibility**: Backward-compatible field additions only; renames
require a major version bump of the chart's umbrella schema.

#### `insight-identity-config` Secret

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-contract-identity-config-secret`

**Direction**: provided by umbrella chart, consumed by the service
pod via `envFrom`.

**Protocol/Format**: Kubernetes `Secret` (string data) containing
the `IDENTITY__*` keys. URL form preferred
(`IDENTITY__mariadb__url`); MySqlConnector KV form supported
(`IDENTITY__mariadb__connection_string`) for callers needing options
the URL shape cannot express.

**Compatibility**: Stable across chart minor versions; additive fields
non-breaking.

## 8. Use Cases

#### Resolve email to person

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-usecase-identity-lookup-email`

**Actor**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway`

**Preconditions**:
- Seed pipeline has populated at least one `value_type='email'`
  observation for the target tenant.
- Caller's request carries `X-Insight-Tenant-Id` or the service is
  configured with a `tenant_default_id`.

**Main Flow**:
1. api-gateway receives an analytics request that needs person
   enrichment.
2. api-gateway resolves the JWT principal and derives the email +
   tenant header.
3. api-gateway issues `GET /v1/persons/{email}` to the service.
4. The service lowercases the email, resolves the `person_id` via the
   latest-per-source email observation, hydrates all attributes, and
   returns 200 + JSON.
5. api-gateway merges the person object into the analytics response.

**Postconditions**:
- The analytics response carries the resolved person attributes.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **No observation matches**: service returns 404 + RFC 7807 problem
  details; api-gateway includes a `person_unresolved` flag in the
  analytics response.
- **No tenant**: service returns 400 +
  `urn:insight:error:tenant_unresolved`; api-gateway returns 401 to
  the original caller (the missing tenant means the principal was
  not properly resolved).

#### Liveness and readiness

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-usecase-identity-probes`

**Actor**: `cpt-insightspec-actor-platform-sre`

**Preconditions**:
- Pod is scheduled with the Helm probe wiring.

**Main Flow**:
1. kubelet hits `/healthz` every 10 s for liveness.
2. kubelet hits `/health` every 5 s for readiness.
3. A failing `/health` (DB unreachable) flips the pod out of the
   Service endpoints until the pool recovers.

**Postconditions**:
- Traffic is routed only to pods whose DB pool is healthy.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] An integration test against a Testcontainers MariaDB returns
      the seeded Alice record with email, display_name, job_title
      fields populated.
- [ ] The same integration test returns 404 + RFC 7807 body for an
      unknown email.
- [ ] The same integration test returns 400 +
      `urn:insight:error:tenant_unresolved` when the request omits
      the tenant header and no default is configured.
- [ ] `dotnet test` passes for both unit and integration projects on
      a fresh checkout.
- [ ] Helm template renders `Service`, `Deployment`, `Secret`, and
      `_helpers.tpl` host references with the canonical
      `insight-identity` name.
- [ ] DbUp creates `persons` and `account_person_map` against an
      empty `identity` MariaDB on first pod start; re-running the
      pod is a no-op against `SchemaVersions`.
- [ ] `cypilot validate --skip-code --artifact docs/components/backend/identity-resolution/identity`
      reports zero errors.

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| MariaDB `identity` database | Read target + DbUp migration target. | p1 |
| Seed pipeline (`seed-persons-from-identity-input.py`) | Populates the rows the reader returns. | p1 |
| BambooHR `bamboohr__identity_inputs` dbt model | Source of identity observations for the first connector to land on the new schema. | p1 |
| Reconciliation service (future) | Writes `parent_person_id` observations consumed by Phase 2 org-tree expansion. | p2 |
| api-gateway | Sole external caller in Phase 1. | p1 |

## 11. Assumptions

- Single MariaDB database per service instance — no sharding, no
  multi-region writes from this service.
- The seed pipeline's `INSERT IGNORE` semantics guarantee no duplicate
  observations under the natural-key UNIQUE; the reader does not
  deduplicate beyond `ROW_NUMBER()` filtering.
- `insight_tenant_id` is a `BINARY(16)` UUID for the lifetime of this
  service; if the project adopts string tenants the schema (and this
  PRD) need a major revision.
- All callers in the Insight platform forward via api-gateway —
  external direct callers are out of scope until OIDC subject mapping
  ships.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| `persons` schema evolves under us | Reader SQL drifts and silently returns wrong fields. | Centralise SQL in `Insight.Identity.Infrastructure/MariaDb/Sql.cs`; integration tests pin column names. |
| Misconfigured `tenant_default_id` in multi-tenant cluster | Wrong-tenant data leaks to a header-less caller. | Composite resolver always lets header win; helm validator warns when `tenantDefaultId` is set with `identity.deploy=true` in a production overlay (planned). |
| Seed pipeline never runs on a fresh cluster | Every lookup returns 404 indefinitely. | `/health` only checks DB reachability — the operator sees green pods and an empty `persons` table; document the post-install seed step in the README. |
| BambooHR connector evolves the `value_type` set | New observations are silently ignored. | Hardcoded routing in ADR-0007 + integration test that asserts the projection of each known `value_type`. |
