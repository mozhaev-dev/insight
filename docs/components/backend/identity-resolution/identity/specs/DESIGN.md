## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

`insight-identity-resolution` is a synchronous read path over the
multi-source observation log in MariaDB `persons`. It collapses
observations into a single `PersonResponse` per request by ranking rows
per `(insight_source_type, insight_source_id, value_type)` partition and
picking the latest value per `value_type` across sources. The service
is stateless beyond its connection pool, owns its database (SeaORM
migrations applied via the service's `migrate` subcommand), and follows
the layered `api` → `domain` → `infra` module split of the gears-rust
host (ported from the retired .NET service, epic #1602).

The vision is **operational simplicity**: zero in-memory cache, every
read hits MariaDB on a covered index; first-install behaviour is
"every lookup returns 404" rather than "crash loop"; logs are
PII-redacted JSON; failures are RFC 7807 problem-details bodies with
a sanitised `db_target` for DB exceptions and a stable error URN.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-resolve-by-email`](PRD.md#resolve-email-to-person_id) | `persons_repo::resolve_person_ids_by_email` issues a `SELECT person_id FROM persons WHERE value_type='email' AND value_id=? AND insight_tenant_id=? ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1` against the `idx_value_id` covered index. |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-resolve-by-person-id` | `value_type='person_id'` needs no resolution step: `api/handlers.rs::resolve_person_id_mode` validates the UUID (nil and non-UUID are 400s, never a silent empty resolution), rejects the source fields (a person id is tenant-wide), and confirms the person exists in the tenant via `persons_repo::person_exists`; an unobserved id yields no candidate so the handler answers 404 like an unknown email. Visibility applies unchanged, so a person's name and their metrics answer to ONE permission — the SPA routes on `person_id` since the identity cutover, and a person without a current email is reachable only this way. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-hydrate`](PRD.md#hydrate-person-attributes) | `persons_repo::fetch_person_observations` runs a `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)` CTE returning one row per (source, value_type); the assembler in `domain/profile.rs` then picks the latest across sources. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-404`](PRD.md#not-found-returns-rfc-7807) | The profile handler returns an RFC 7807 body with `type=urn:insight:error:person_not_found`, `status=404` when the resolve step matches nothing. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-400-tenant`](PRD.md#missing-tenant-returns-rfc-7807) | The tenant comes from the verified JWT's `tenant_id` claim (oidc-authn-plugin SecurityContext); when no tenant resolves the handler returns an RFC 7807 body (`type=urn:insight:error:tenant_unresolved`, `status=400`). |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-parent`](PRD.md#surface-parent-attributes-when-present) | `handlers::resolve_parent` reads the single CURRENT parent edge from `org_chart` filtered to the configured `org_chart_source_type` (BambooHR by default — Phase 2 of #348), then hydrates the parent's own observations to fill `supervisor_email` (parent's email), `supervisor_name` (parent's display name), and the legacy `parent_*` triple (`parent_email` = parent's email, `parent_id` = parent's `value_type='id'` on the same source instance, `parent_person_id` = the edge's `parent_person_id`). The `ParentProjection` flows into the profile assembler; stale `value_type='parent_*'` observations in `persons` are ignored. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-lookup-subordinates`](PRD.md#recursively-expand-subordinates) | `handlers::resolve_subordinates` walks `persons_repo::current_children_for_parent` recursively via `hydrate_children`, filters edges to the configured `org_chart_source_type`, hydrates each child with the same recursion (depth-counted), and feeds the resulting list into the response's `subordinates`. Cycle protection is a visited-set of `person_id`s; depth cap reads from the gear config's `max_depth`. The same recursion serves `/v1/profiles`. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-routing-name-split`](PRD.md#display-name-split-fallback) | The display-name split fallback runs after assembly when both `first_name` and `last_name` observations are missing. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-migrations-startup`](PRD.md#service-owned-migrations-at-startup) | The service's `migrate` subcommand runs the SeaORM migrator (`src/migration/`, SQL embedded from `src/migration/sql/`) before the service serves traffic; in Kubernetes it runs as an initContainer. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-schema-relax-uniqueness`](PRD.md#schema-allows-recording-state-transitions) | Migration `004_persons_relax_constraints.sql` drops `UNIQUE uq_person_observation` on `(..., value_hash)` and adds the same name on `(..., created_at)`. The seeder's `INSERT IGNORE` in step 7 now dedupes by `created_at` (re-runs idempotent) while genuine transitions on the same partition (Active->Inactive->Active) persist as separate rows. ADR-0011 documents the design decision. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-schema-case-insensitive-value-id`](PRD.md#value-comparisons-are-case-insensitive) | The same migration `ALTER COLUMN value_id MODIFY ... COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci`. `idx_value_id` rebuilds under the new collation; existing SQL (`WHERE value_id = @x`) is now case-insensitive without code changes. `value_full_text` is already `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`; `value` (TEXT) uses table default `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`; `value_hash` (CHAR ascii) stays `ascii_bin` as it is a SHA-256 digest. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-profile-resolve`](PRD.md#resolve-profile-by-email-or-source-native-id) | The `POST /v1/profiles` handler (`api/handlers.rs::resolve_profile`) routes by the request's `value_type` (`email` or `id`) to `persons_repo::resolve_person_ids_by_email` / `resolve_person_ids_by_source_id`. Both queries are CTEs with partition `(insight_tenant_id, person_id, insight_source_type, insight_source_id, value_type)` and `rn=1` filter — the canonical latest-per-source-instance projection. |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-visible-persons-batch` | `POST /v1/visible-persons` (`api/visible_persons.rs::filter_visible_persons`) answers which of the requested canonical person ids (UUIDs) the caller may see. `subchart_repo::visible_targets` materialises the visible-set union once — caller, active grants, the whole tenant on a wildcard grant, `org_chart` descendants — and joins the requested ids against it; `has_wildcard_grant` short-circuits the traversal (echoing the request, so its answer is a subset of the input rather than a tenant-existence check). No email resolution step exists: the metrics runtime keys on `person_id` since the identity cutover, so the ids arrive canonical. Roles are absent from the predicate, so the `admin` role confers no visibility (ADR-0015). |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-visible-persons-policy` | The visible set follows `visibility_policy` (`config.rs::VisibilityPolicy`): `org_chart` unions the caller, their active grants and the `org_chart` descendants of both; `flat` unions the tenant's persons instead, for an organisation whose roster carries no reporting lines. Bound as one parameter into the same CTEs, so the batch filter, the profile gate, the subchart reads and the roster cannot disagree. Nothing is written to `visibility`, and grants and roles keep their meaning under either policy. `GET /v1/me` reports the policy so a consumer need not infer it from an empty `subordinates` list. |
| `cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-visible-persons-roster` | `GET /v1/visible-persons` (`api/visible_persons.rs::list_visible_persons`) enumerates the persons the caller may see, a page at a time. It is the operator listing (`infra::db::person_listing::list_persons`) restricted by `VisibleTo`, so the roster and the picker share one label rule, one order and one keyset cursor — the restriction adds the `visible_set` CTE and an `EXISTS` over it, nothing else. The cursor carries its own `PagePosition::KIND`, so a picker position cannot resume a roster listing. Self-scoped and not admin-gated, on the same ground as the batch read (ADR-0015): it enumerates only what the caller's visible set already contains. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-profile-ambiguous-422`](PRD.md#surface-single-result-invariant-via-422) | The resolve step distinguishes found / not-found / ambiguous. When the reader returns `>1` distinct `person_id`, the handler emits an RFC 7807 extension body carrying the lookup body + the matched `person_ids` list with status 422. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-profile-ids-list`](PRD.md#project-full-alias-list-on-response) | `persons_repo::current_source_ids_for_person` returns the latest `value_type='id'` per source instance; the profile assembler ships the list unchanged into the `ProfileResponse` wire shape (`domain/profile.rs::ProfileIdEntry`). |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-profile-org-tree`](PRD.md#project-the-same-org-tree-shape-as-v1persons) | The profile handler hydrates the same `Person` tree (`hydrate_person`) that the retired GET endpoint returned, copying `supervisor_email` / `supervisor_name` / `parent_email` / `parent_id` / `parent_person_id` / `subordinates` straight off the projection. Identical `Person` shape across callers — guaranteed by reusing the recursion. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-profile-validation`](PRD.md#validate-request-body-via-fluentvalidation) | Request-body validation in the handler expresses the cross-field rules (`value_type=='id'` requires source coordinates; `value_type=='email'` forbids them) before resolving the tenant; first-error wins on `urn:insight:error:*` URN. (Ported from the retired .NET FluentValidation validator.) |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-org-chart-table`](PRD.md#materialised-parentchild-edge-cache) | Migration `003_org_chart.sql` adds the SCD2 edge table with PK `(tenant, source_type, source_id, child, valid_from)`, CHECK `no_self_loop`, and indexes on current-parent / current-children / cross-source views; ADR-0010 records the design decision. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-org-chart-rebuild`](PRD.md#rebuild-edges-from-persons-deterministically) | `seed-persons-from-identity-input.py` step 9 builds `org_chart_next` from a UNION of `value_type='parent_person_id'` (Source 1, future reconciliation) and `value_type='parent_email'` JOINed to the latest `value_type='email'` observation per `(tenant, value_id)` partition (Source 2, current pipeline); Source 1 wins via NOT EXISTS guard. Step 5 sorts accounts BambooHR-first so the canonical `supervisorEmail` source establishes `person_id`s before downstream connectors. Source 2 intersects each `parent_email` period with the child's **active intervals** derived from `value_type='status'` observations (Active/Inactive/Terminated, with LAG to collapse duplicates and LEAD to compute interval ends); children without any status observation get a synthetic [-inf,+inf) interval. Re-activation (Inactive -> Active) produces a fresh row rather than reopening the closed one — SCD2 history is preserved. Two-table swap via `RENAME` mirrors step 8. Parent_emails with no email-bearer in `persons` are skipped and counted in the seeder log (no stubs created — see ADR-0010). Post-swap two-hop cycle detection self-joins CURRENT edges and emits a WARN line if `(A->B)` and `(B->A)` co-exist; deeper cycles are bounded structurally by the Phase-3 subchart endpoint's depth parameter. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-fr-identity-org-chart-read`](PRD.md#read-current-parent-and-children-edges) | `persons_repo::current_parents_for_child` / `current_children_for_parent` issue `SELECT ... WHERE child_person_id=? AND valid_to IS NULL` (respectively `parent_person_id=?`); the query strings live with the repository, materialised as `OrgChartEdge` rows. |

#### NFR Allocation

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [`cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-latency`](PRD.md#p95-lookup-latency) | Single-row covered-index lookup (`idx_value_id`) + the SeaORM (SQLx) connection pool; pool max size tuned to 16 (smaller than the analytics service per design review). |
| [`cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-memory`](PRD.md#memory-budget-without-caching) | No in-memory cache; helm `resources.limits.memory: 384Mi`; query results materialised row-by-row from the driver. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-logging-pii`](PRD.md#structured-json-logs-with-pii-redaction) | Structured JSON logs via the gears host's tracing subscriber; email-bearing path segments are logged as route templates, never raw values; the error layer emits a sanitised `db_target` for DB errors only. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-nfr-identity-uuid-roundtrip`](PRD.md#binary16-uuid-round-trip) | All UUID parameters are bound as 16-byte `BINARY(16)` values (big-endian RFC 4122 order) and read back the same way. Integration test pins the round-trip. |

### 1.3 Architecture Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Module |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Api** | HTTP surface — route handlers, request/response DTOs, auth (JWT-derived tenant), error → RFC 7807 mapping. | `src/api/` |
| **Domain** | Lookup orchestration + observation collapse — profile assembly, display-name split fallback, subchart tree building, seed logic. Pure Rust, no DB or HTTP types. | `src/domain/` |
| **Infrastructure** | Persistence + migrations — SeaORM pool, `persons_repo` and sibling repositories, centralised named SQL (`sql_named.rs`), the SeaORM migrator + `src/migration/sql/*.sql`. | `src/infra/` |

Dependency direction is strict: api → domain → infra; domain
does not reference SeaORM or HTTP framework types. Repository
functions in `infra/db/` materialise rows into the domain shapes.

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Observation log, not relational tree

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-identity-observation-log`

The reader treats `persons` as an append-only event log. There are no
foreign-key joins for org-tree traversal — the supervisor edge is
expressed as `parent_person_id` observations written by the
reconciliation service. Phase 1 surfaces those observations
verbatim; Phase 2 will walk them recursively. The service never
mutates `persons` — that is the seed pipeline's and the future
reconciliation service's job.

#### Centralised SQL

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-identity-centralised-sql`

SQL statements live with the repositories under
`src/infra/db/` (named statements centralised in `sql_named.rs`).
A schema evolution (column rename, index addition) touches one place;
the repository is purely binding + materialisation. This keeps the
"how" of the latest-per-source CTE auditable in one place.

#### Tenant from the verified JWT, config default opt-in

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-identity-tenant-composite`

The tenant is the `tenant_id` claim of the gateway JWT verified by the
oidc-authn-plugin (mapped to `subject_tenant_id` in the
SecurityContext). The config `tenant_default_id` is an opt-in default
for single-tenant clusters (and the bootstrap-admin seed).
Multi-tenant production overlays leave the default empty. (The .NET
service's header-first composite resolver is retired — a tenant from
the outside world never passes.)

#### Fail fast at startup, not at first request

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-identity-fail-fast`

The SeaORM migrator (the `migrate` subcommand, run as an initContainer
in Kubernetes) completes before the service serves traffic. A bad
connection string or a failed migration fails the pod immediately;
kubelet retries. The service never serves traffic against an
unmigrated database.

#### PII boundary at the logger

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-principle-identity-pii-boundary`

Every log enrichment that touches the request goes through an
allow-list. Email-bearing path segments are logged as route templates,
never raw values. There is no log line outside the structured tracing
framework — no `println!`, no raw email interpolation.

### 2.2 Constraints

#### gears-rust host / workspace Rust toolchain

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-identity-dotnet-9`

The service is a gear on the gears-rust host and builds with the
workspace-pinned Rust toolchain (ported from the retired .NET 9
implementation, epic #1602). It ships in the shared backend workspace
at `src/backend/services/identity-resolution/`.

#### SeaORM MySQL backend for MariaDB

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-identity-mysqlconnector`

The MariaDB-flavoured wire protocol is served by SeaORM's MySQL
(SQLx) backend. The dependency is pinned in the service's
`Cargo.toml` and surfaced via the `infra/db` module; no other code
path in domain or api touches the driver.

#### SeaORM migrator for migrations

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-identity-dbup-version`

The SeaORM migrator is the migration mechanism (see ADR-0006; it
replaced the retired .NET service's DbUp). Migration steps live in
`src/migration/` (one Rust file per step) and embed their SQL from
`src/migration/sql/`. They are applied via the service's `migrate`
subcommand, which also runs the migrate-time first-admin bootstrap.

#### `BINARY(16)` for every UUID

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-identity-binary16-uuid`

A byte-exact UUID round-trip is required (NFR-uuid-roundtrip). No
column may store a UUID as a 36-char `CHAR(36)` — the schema, the
parameter binding, and the read path all enforce 16-byte bytes.

#### Structured JSON logging only

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-constraint-identity-serilog-compact-json`

No console plain-text logging is allowed in production builds.
A local-dev config overlay may enable human-readable console output,
but production stays structured JSON for log aggregation parity.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

| Concept | Representation | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| `Person` | `domain::profile::PersonResponse` (immutable). Fields: `person_id`, `email`, `display_name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `department`, `division`, `job_title`, `status`, `supervisor_email`, `supervisor_name`, `parent_email`, `parent_id`, `parent_person_id`, `subordinates`. The `supervisor_*` pair and the legacy `parent_*` triple are both populated from the single `org_chart` edge filtered to the configured `org_chart_source_type`; `subordinates` is the recursive BambooHR-only subtree (empty list = leaf). | Wire shape — see [`PRD.md#get-v1personsemail--person-lookup`](PRD.md#get-v1personsemail--person-lookup). |
| `Profile` | `domain::profile::ProfileResponse` — superset of `Person` for `POST /v1/profiles`. Adds `insight_tenant_id`, `username`, `employee_id`, and `ids[]` (all current `value_type='id'` observations, one per source instance). Optional fields are nullable rather than empty strings; the API layer drops nulls from JSON. | Wire shape — see [`PRD.md#post-v1profiles--profile-resolution`](PRD.md#post-v1profiles--profile-resolution). |
| `PersonObservation` | One row from `persons` projected into `(insight_source_type, insight_source_id, value_type, value_effective, created_at)` by `infra/db/persons_repo.rs`. | Domain-level shape; `value_effective` is the DB-generated coalesce. |
| `OrgChartEdge` | One CURRENT parent->child edge from `org_chart` (`infra/db/persons_repo.rs::OrgChartEdge`). Fields: `insight_source_type`, `insight_source_id`, `child_person_id`, `parent_person_id`, `valid_from`. | Domain-level; not part of the wire surface. |
| `ParentProjection` | `domain::profile::ParentProjection` — the parent edge resolved into the fields the assembler writes: parent's `person_id`, `email`, `display_name`, and source-native id (on the same source instance as the edge). | Internal contract between parent resolution (producer) and profile assembly (consumer). |
| `PersonSourceId` | One source-native id binding for the `ids[]` projection on the profile response. Fields: `insight_source_type`, `insight_source_id`, `value`. | Domain-level shape; wire form is `ProfileIdEntry`. |
| `ValueTypes` | Constants enumerating canonical `value_type` strings. | Free-form on the DB side; the enumeration documents the set the assembler projects. |
| Persons reader | Repository functions in `infra/db/persons_repo.rs` — `resolve_person_ids_by_email` / `fetch_person_observations` (lookup), `resolve_person_ids_by_source_id` / `current_source_ids_for_person` (profile resolution), `current_parents_for_child` / `current_children_for_parent` (org_chart reads). | The infra layer's read surface over `persons` / `org_chart`. |
| Tenant context | The verified JWT's `tenant_id` claim, mapped by the oidc-authn-plugin into the SecurityContext (`subject_tenant_id`). | Config `tenant_default_id` is an opt-in default for single-tenant clusters. |
| `LookupOptions` | Lookup options passed from the API layer into hydration: `expand_subordinates`, `max_depth`, `org_chart_source_type`. Parent hydration is unconditional (always populated when an `org_chart` edge exists); only the subordinates recursion is gated. | Bound from the gear config (`GearConfig`) per request. Defaults: `expand_subordinates: true`, `max_depth: 16`, `org_chart_source_type: "bamboohr"`. |

### 3.2 Component Model

#### api module (`src/api/`)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-api`

##### Why this component exists

To translate HTTP requests into domain calls and domain results into
RFC 7807 responses, owning every concern that is HTTP- or
hosting-specific so that domain and infra remain free of HTTP
framework types.

##### Responsibility scope

- Registers the route handlers on the gears-rust host's router.
- Consumes configuration from the gear config
  (`gears.identity-resolution.config` in the host YAML) +
  `APP__gears__identity-resolution__config__*` env overrides.
- Wires the SeaORM pool, the repositories, and the seed worker into
  the handler state.
- Structured JSON logging via the host's tracing subscriber
  (`service=identity-resolution`, PII-redacting request logging).
- Migrations are applied by the service's `migrate` subcommand
  (initContainer in Kubernetes) before the serving process starts.
- Maps `POST /v1/profiles` (the successor of the retired
  `GET /v1/persons/{email}` — dropped together with the .NET service,
  zero callers), `GET /internal/persons/by-email/{email}`
  (internal-only), `/health`, `/healthz`.
- Implements the error mapping that emits RFC 7807
  bodies with sanitised `db_target` for DB errors only.

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Does **not** issue SQL. Repository access is via the `infra/db`
  repositories only.
- Does **not** parse `persons` rows. Materialisation is in
  `persons_repo`.
- Does **not** apply migrations at request time — the SeaORM migrator
  runs in the `migrate` subcommand.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-domain` — orchestrates lookups.
- `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-infra` — persistence + migrations.
- `cpt-insightspec-actor-api-gateway` — sole external caller in Phase 1.

#### domain module (`src/domain/`)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-domain`

##### Why this component exists

To carry the lookup orchestration and observation-collapse logic in
a layer that has zero compile-time coupling to the HTTP framework or
SeaORM. This keeps unit tests of the assembly and display-name-split
logic fast and makes the algorithm legible in isolation from the
SQL strings.

##### Responsibility scope

- Email lookup — trims the email, resolves `person_id`
  (case-insensitive via the column collation per ADR-0011), fetches
  latest-per-source observations, hands them to the assembler.
- Profile assembly (`domain/profile.rs`) — collapses per-`value_type`
  observations across sources by latest `created_at`, falls back to
  the display-name split when `first_name`/`last_name` are absent.
- Display-name split — handles `"Last, First"`
  and `"First Last"` formats; single-token names yield
  `(token, "")`.
- Canonical `value_type` constants used by the assembler.
- Subchart tree building (`domain/subchart.rs`) and the persons-seed
  logic (`domain/seed.rs`, `domain/seed_service.rs`).

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Does **not** open MariaDB connections — that's the SeaORM pool in
  infra.
- Does **not** know which `value_type` routes to which physical
  column — that's the seed pipeline's contract (ADR-0007) and the
  repository's SQL.
- Does **not** map results to JSON — that's the api layer's
  serialiser.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-api` — consumes the lookup
  service.
- `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-infra` — implements
  `IPersonsReader`.

#### infra module (`src/infra/`)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-infra`

##### Why this component exists

To isolate every MariaDB-specific detail (connection handling,
`BINARY(16)` parameter binding, `ROW_NUMBER()` CTE, the SeaORM
migrator) in one module so the domain code stays portable and so a
future read replica or backup target can be swapped in without
touching the lookup algorithm.

##### Responsibility scope

- SeaORM connection pool over the configured `database_url`
  (`mysql://user:pass@host:port/db`); log context uses a sanitised
  target (`host:port/db`, no creds).
- `persons_repo` and sibling repositories (`roles_repo`,
  `person_roles_repo`, `visibility_repo`, `subchart_repo`,
  `seed_repo`, `ops_repo`) — bind UUIDs as `BINARY(16)` bytes and
  materialise domain rows.
- `sql_named.rs` — centralised named SQL; the latest-per-source CTE
  is one of the documented SQL artefacts (see §3.7).
- The SeaORM migrator (`src/migration/`) — one Rust step per change,
  SQL embedded from `src/migration/sql/`, run by the `migrate`
  subcommand together with the first-admin bootstrap
  (`infra/db/bootstrap.rs`).
- The ClickHouse `identity_inputs` reader
  (`infra/identity_inputs.rs`) over the shared HTTP ClickHouse client
  (port 8123).

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Does **not** decide tenant routing or display-name fallback —
  that's Domain.
- Does **not** emit HTTP responses — that's Api.
- Does **not** orchestrate the seed pipeline — that's
  `src/backend/services/identity-resolution/seed/`.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-insightspec-component-identity-domain` — implements its
  port.
- `cpt-insightspec-actor-mariadb` — runtime target.

### 3.3 API Contracts

This section enumerates the public interfaces declared in the PRD's
Public Library Interfaces section (§7) and pins them to concrete
implementation details.

| PRD Interface | Implementation | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| [`cpt-insightspec-interface-identity-person-lookup`](PRD.md#get-v1personsemail--person-lookup) | **Retired** together with the .NET service (approved removal, zero callers). `POST /v1/profiles` (`api/handlers.rs::resolve_profile`) is the successor; an internal-only `GET /internal/persons/by-email/{email}` remains for in-cluster use. Snake-case JSON. | Kept for historical traceability. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-interface-identity-health`](PRD.md#get-health--database-readiness) | Health handler — opens a connection, runs `SELECT 1`. | 200 / 503. |
| [`cpt-insightspec-interface-identity-healthz`](PRD.md#get-healthz--process-liveness) | Liveness handler returning `"ok"`. | Never touches DB. |

External contracts:

- [`cpt-insightspec-contract-identity-env-config`](PRD.md#identity_-env-var-contract) —
  honoured by the gears-rust host's config loader: YAML section
  `gears.identity-resolution.config` with
  `APP__gears__identity-resolution__config__<field>` env overrides;
  bound to the strongly-typed `GearConfig` struct.
- [`cpt-insightspec-contract-identity-config-secret`](PRD.md#insight-identity-config-secret) —
  consumed via `envFrom: secretRef: insight-identity-resolution-config`
  in the Deployment template (see
  `src/backend/services/identity-resolution/helm/`).

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

| Dependency Module | Interface Used | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| `src/domain/` | Profile assembly, display-name split, subchart + seed logic | Lookup orchestration + observation collapse. |
| `src/infra/` | `persons_repo` + sibling repositories, SeaORM pool, SeaORM migrator | MariaDB persistence + migrations. |
| `charts/insight/templates/secrets.yaml` (umbrella) | Emits `insight-identity-resolution-config` with `APP__gears__identity-resolution__config__database_url` etc. | Runtime config supply. |
| `charts/insight/templates/mariadb-initdb-scripts.yaml` (umbrella) | Provisions empty `identity` database + grants on first MariaDB pod boot. | Empty DB substrate for the SeaORM migrator. |

### 3.5 External Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Why | Failure mode |
|------------|---------|-----|--------------|
| sea-orm (MySQL/SQLx backend) | workspace-pinned | MariaDB-flavoured wire protocol; `BINARY(16)` UUID binding; connection pool. | Pool exhaustion → 503 on `/health`; pod restart on transient connectivity loss. |
| sea-orm-migration | workspace-pinned | Schema migration applied via the `migrate` subcommand; tracks `seaql_migrations`. | Failed migration → the `migrate` subcommand exits non-zero, the initContainer fails and the pod never serves. |
| tracing (gears-rust host subscriber) | workspace-pinned | Structured JSON logs, request logging, PII redaction. | Logger init failure → process exits; no fallback. |
| insight-clickhouse (HTTP client) | workspace | Reads `identity.identity_inputs` over ClickHouse HTTP (port 8123) for the persons-seed worker. | Seed run fails with a bounded timeout; the read API is unaffected. |
| testcontainers (Rust, test only) | workspace-pinned | Spins up a real MariaDB for integration tests (`cargo test -p identity-resolution`). | Test failure when Docker unavailable; not a runtime concern. |

### 3.6 Interactions & Sequences

                                                       api-gateway merges
```

1. api-gateway calls `POST /v1/profiles`
   (`{"value_type":"email","value":"alice@example.com"}`) with the
   ES256 gateway JWT.
2. The oidc-authn-plugin verifies the JWT and maps its `tenant_id`
   claim into the SecurityContext.
3. The handler trims the email (case handled at the storage layer per
   ADR-0011).
4. `persons_repo::resolve_person_ids_by_email` issues
   `SELECT person_id FROM persons WHERE insight_tenant_id=? AND
   value_type='email' AND value_id=? ORDER BY created_at DESC,
   id DESC LIMIT 1` on the `idx_value_id` covered index.
5. `persons_repo::fetch_person_observations` runs the
   `ROW_NUMBER()` CTE, returning one row per (source, value_type).
6. The profile assembler collapses across sources by latest
   `created_at`, running the display-name split if first/last absent.
7. The handler serialises to snake-case JSON; returns 200.

#### Tenant unresolved

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-seq-identity-tenant-unresolved`

```
caller  →  identity-resolution  →  tenant resolution
                                       │
                            (no tenant_id claim, no default)
                                       │
                                       ▼
                            RFC 7807 problem body
                                       │
                                       ▼
                       400 + RFC 7807 problem-details
```

The tenant comes from the verified JWT's `tenant_id` claim, with the
config `tenant_default_id` as an opt-in fallback; if neither yields a
tenant, the endpoint returns
`urn:insight:error:tenant_unresolved` with status 400.

#### Startup with migration

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-seq-identity-startup`

```
kubelet  →  initContainer: identity-resolution migrate
                                    │
                                    ▼
                          gear config bind (GearConfig)

                          SeaORM Migrator::up
                            │      (steps in src/migration/,
                            │       SQL from src/migration/sql/)
                            ▼
                          first-admin bootstrap (infra/db/bootstrap.rs)
                            │      (failure → non-zero exit, pod restart)
                            ▼
                          main container: serve
                                    │
                                    ▼
                          /health, /healthz, /v1/profiles
```

SeaORM's `seaql_migrations` table guarantees each step applies once
across pod restarts; idempotency is at the script level (every DDL
uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`). When `bootstrap_admin_person_id`
is configured, the `migrate` subcommand also seeds the first active
`admin` assignment in `tenant_default_id` unless one already exists
(the migrate-time first-admin bootstrap, ported from the .NET
`BootstrapAdminRunner`).

### 3.7 Database schemas & tables

The service is a **reader** of `persons` and the migrator of the
`identity` MariaDB database.

#### Table: `persons` (MariaDB)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-dbtable-identity-persons`

Defined in `src/migration/sql/001_persons.sql`
(applied by the SeaORM migrator via the `migrate` subcommand).
Canonical column reference:
[docs/domain/identity-resolution/specs/DESIGN.md §"Table: persons"](../../../../../domain/identity-resolution/specs/DESIGN.md#table-persons-mariadb).

The service reads it via two queries (centralised with the
repository in `src/infra/db/`):

```sql
-- Sql.ResolvePersonIdByEmail
SELECT person_id
FROM persons
WHERE insight_tenant_id = @tenant_id
  AND value_type = 'email'
  AND value_id   = @email
ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Sql.LatestObservationsByPersonId
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT
    person_id, insight_source_type, insight_source_id,
    value_type, value_effective, created_at,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY insight_source_type, insight_source_id, value_type
      ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC
    ) AS rn
  FROM persons
  WHERE insight_tenant_id = @tenant_id
    AND person_id         = @person_id
)
SELECT person_id, insight_source_type, insight_source_id,
       value_type, value_effective, created_at
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1;
```

Both queries are tenant-scoped first; the `idx_value_id` covered
index satisfies the resolve query without a heap read, and the
`(insight_tenant_id, person_id, ...)` selectivity keeps the
hydrate CTE bounded by per-person observation count (typically
< 100 rows).

#### Table: `account_person_map` (MariaDB)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-dbtable-identity-account-person-map`

Defined in `src/migration/sql/002_account_person_map.sql`.
The service migrates the table but does **not** read it in
Phase 1 — the seed pipeline rebuilds it as an SCD2 cache from
`persons` (see
[domain DESIGN §"Table: account_person_map"](../../../../../domain/identity-resolution/specs/DESIGN.md#table-account_person_map-mariadb)).
Future Phase 2 lookups will use it for "as-of" account → person
binding queries.

#### Table: `org_chart` (MariaDB)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-dbtable-identity-org-chart`

Defined in `src/migration/sql/003_org_chart.sql`
(see ADR-0010). The service migrates and reads the table — the
seed pipeline (`seed-persons-from-identity-input.py` step 9)
rebuilds it as an SCD2 cache of direct parent->child edges
derived from `persons` via two sources: `value_type='parent_person_id'`
observations (Source 1, future reconciliation service) and
`value_type='parent_email'` observations resolved by JOIN to the
latest matching `value_type='email'` observation per tenant
(Source 2, the current pipeline's only edge producer). Source 2
intersects each parent_email period with the child's active
intervals derived from `value_type='status'` observations.

The Phase-1 invariant is at most one CURRENT edge per
`(tenant, source_type, source_id, child)`; multi-parent (matrix
orgs) becomes a Phase-1.5 change that adds `parent_person_id` to
the PK.

Read paths in Phase 1:
- `persons_repo::current_parents_for_child(tenant, child)` —
  `WHERE child_person_id=? AND valid_to IS NULL` against
  `idx_current_parent`.
- `persons_repo::current_children_for_parent(tenant, parent)` —
  `WHERE parent_person_id=? AND valid_to IS NULL` against
  `idx_current_children`.

Phase 2 callers project these onto the `/v1/persons` and
`/v1/profiles` response shapes (designated-source supervisor +
per-source detail). Phase 3 (`/v1/subchart/{person_id}?depth=N`,
issue #348) walks the table via a depth-bounded recursive CTE in a
single round-trip — `SqlSubchart.GetSubchart` joins a recursive
`subtree` CTE rooted at `@root_person_id` (depth-bounded by the
optional `@max_depth` parameter; null = unbounded, capped by
MariaDB's `cte_max_recursion_depth = 1000`) against a derived
`latest_obs` CTE that picks the latest `(person, value_type)`
observation per partition via `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)`. Tenant +
source-type scoping is bound on both CTEs. The result is a flat
row set ordered by depth; the service layer (`domain/subchart.rs`)
assembles the tree by indexing on `parent_person_id`. Visibility is
applied to the root only — the
visibility CTE is closed under `org_chart` descent, so once the
viewer can see the root every descendant is already in their
visible set.

#### Table: `seaql_migrations` (MariaDB, SeaORM-managed)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-dbtable-identity-schema-versions`

SeaORM's migration tracker table (it replaced the retired .NET
service's DbUp `SchemaVersions`). Created automatically on the first
`migrate` run if absent; the service does not interact with it
directly. Provides idempotency for pod restarts.

### 3.8 Schema + Naming Conventions

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-insightspec-design-identity-conventions`

Conventions locked during PR #517 for the Identity Resolution
service. Newly added tables and Domain types MUST follow them; an
existing table that violates a convention is migrated at the next
touch (per the project-wide "consistency over scope" rule).

#### SQL columns

1. **Audit datetime columns** use `DATETIME(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT (UTC_TIMESTAMP(6))`.
   `UTC_TIMESTAMP` forces UTC regardless of session `time_zone`;
   `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` would defer to session config and silently
   drift under multi-region deploys. MariaDB 10.2+ requires
   expression DEFAULTs to be parenthesised — `DEFAULT (UTC_TIMESTAMP(6))`,
   not `DEFAULT UTC_TIMESTAMP(6)`. `TIMESTAMP` as a column type is
   not used in new tables; it auto-converts to session timezone
   on read.

2. **`valid_from` / `valid_to` SCD2 columns** are `DATETIME(6) NOT NULL`
   (no column-level default — filled at INSERT). `valid_to` is NULL
   for the currently-active row; the schema enforces the sane
   interval order via `CHECK (valid_to IS NULL OR valid_from <= valid_to)`.

   **`valid_from` default-on-INSERT semantics:** when the caller
   doesn't supply `valid_from` (POST body field omitted / null), the
   INSERT statement substitutes `UTC_TIMESTAMP(6)` server-side via
   `IFNULL(@valid_from, UTC_TIMESTAMP(6))`. The repository binds
   SQL NULL for the parameter rather than passing the client
   clock's now; both timestamps in a subsequent
   `valid_to = UTC_TIMESTAMP(6)` soft-delete then come from the same
   clock (the DB server) and the CHECK constraint cannot fail under
   client/server clock skew.

3. **Optional free-text columns** (`reason`, comment-style audit) are
   `VARCHAR(N) NULL` or `TEXT NULL`. NULL == "no value provided",
   distinct from explicit `''`. Existing tables that historically
   used `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` are migrated to NULL at the next
   touch.

4. **Boolean existence probes** use `SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM …)`,
   not `SELECT 1 … LIMIT 1` + null-check. EXISTS returns 0/1
   (never NULL), short-circuits at the planner, and reads as a
   boolean scalar.

5. **BINARY(16) UUID round-trip** uses big-endian RFC 4122 wire
   order: the UUID's canonical bytes (`uuid::Uuid::as_bytes`) when
   binding, and the same order when reading. Established
   by the persons table (see ADR-0002) and mirrored everywhere.

#### Domain entity naming

The Domain record/entity name is the **singular** form of the
table name. Examples:

| Table | Domain entity |
|---|---|
| `visibility` | `Visibility` |
| `roles` | `Role` |
| `person_roles` | `PersonRole` (junction over `persons` + `roles`; mirrors ALMS3 `UserRole`) |

**Exception — observation log / append-only event tables:** when
the table is a log/event-stream AND there's a separate aggregate
that consolidates many rows, the row-entity carries an explicit
suffix to disambiguate. Examples:

| Table | Row entity | Aggregate |
|---|---|---|
| `persons` (observation log per ADR-0003) | `PersonObservation` | `Person` |
| `org_chart` (SCD2 cache of parent→child edges) | `OrgChartEdge` | n/a |

If a future table is unambiguously an entity table (one row =
one identity), use the strict rule. If it's an event log + has a
separate aggregate concept, use the suffix exception.

## 4. Additional context

### 4.1 Configuration surface

Configuration is the gears-rust host config: YAML section
`gears.identity-resolution.config` in `config/insight.yaml`, with
`APP__gears__identity-resolution__config__<field>` env overrides
(bound to `GearConfig`). The listener address lives in the host's
`api-gateway` gear config (`bind_addr: 0.0.0.0:8082` — the same port
the retired .NET service used, so consumers only flipped hostname).

| Config field (env override `APP__gears__identity-resolution__config__<field>`) | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `database_url` | _none_ (required) | `mysql://user:pass@host:port/db`; percent-encoding allowed for users / passwords. |
| `org_chart_source_type` | `bamboohr` | Source instance whose `org_chart` edges populate supervisor/parent fields. |
| `roster_source_type` | _empty_ | The one source trusted to say who exists. The persons-seed mints a person for its accounts even with no address to match on, stamping `roster-mint` on the binding; each such account reaches the review queue as `minted_from_roster` until an operator confirms or reassigns it, and the person stays out of the merge picker until then. Empty disables the branch — an addressless account then stays unresolved. Requirements a roster must meet: it emits an `id` observation per account (the binding row), and it can report deactivation — a source that cannot say a member left will keep leavers minted and queued. Enabling it is not undone by disabling it: `persons` is append-only, so the minted persons and their queue items remain. Since the login bootstrap gained an address mode (`idp.resolve_by = email` on the authenticator), this field also decides WHO MAY SIGN IN on such an install: `GET /internal/persons/by-roster-email` matches only addresses this source states, and refuses outright when the field is empty — so clearing it there denies every login, not just the minting branch. Naming a second source is unsupported, and naming a source type that spans several connector instances defeats it the same way — one addressless human listed twice becomes two persons that nothing can join; the seed warns when it sees either. |
| `expand_subordinates` | `true` | Recursive subordinates subtree on profile responses. |
| `max_depth` | `16` | Max org-tree recursion depth (cycle-safe). |
| `clickhouse_url`, `clickhouse_database`, `clickhouse_user`, `clickhouse_password` | `""` / `identity` / `""` / `""` | ClickHouse HTTP coordinates (port 8123) for reading `identity_inputs` (persons-seed input). |
| `tenant_default_id` | _empty_ | Optional; opt-in for single-tenant clusters and the bootstrap-admin seed. |
| `bootstrap_admin_person_id` | _empty_ | Optional; migrate-time first-admin bootstrap. |

### 4.2 Logging shape

Every log line is structured JSON via the gears-rust host's tracing
subscriber with:

- an RFC 3339 timestamp and level.
- the request method, route template, status code, and elapsed time
  on request-logging lines.
- W3C trace and span IDs (when present).
- `service` — `identity-resolution`.
- the route template, never the raw email path segment.
- For unhandled errors: the error chain; `db_target` (sanitised
  `host:port/db`, no creds) is attached only when the error is a
  database error.
