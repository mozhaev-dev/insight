# CRM Connector Specification (Multi-Source)

> Version 1.0 — March 2026
> Based on: HubSpot (Source 16) and Salesforce (Source 17)

Defines the Silver layer for CRM connectors. The Silver layer has two steps: Step 1 unifies raw Bronze data from source-specific tables (`hubspot_*`, `salesforce_*`) into a common schema; Step 2 enriches with `person_id` via Identity Resolution.

**Primary analytics focus**: internal salespeople (employees) — their deal ownership, activity volume, and workload. External contacts and accounts are reference data only.

**Dual analytics purpose**: CRM connectors serve two distinct analytics use cases that must both be supported:

1. **Pipeline analytics** — deals, stages, pipeline value, win rate, forecast. Answers: *What is in the pipeline? How is it progressing?*
2. **Sales activity analytics** — outreach activity per sales rep: calls made, emails sent, meetings booked, tasks completed. Answers: *How active is each rep? Are they doing the work that leads to deals?*

Sales activity analytics is the primary signal for **Sales rep productivity measurement** — the equivalent of commit count for engineers. A sales rep's pipeline may lag by weeks or months, but activity volume is an immediate, high-frequency signal that reflects current effort. `crm_activities` is the central table for this use case.

## Overview

**Category**: CRM

**Supported Sources**:
- HubSpot (`data_source = "insight_hubspot"`)
- Salesforce (`data_source = "insight_salesforce"`)

**Authentication**:
- HubSpot: Private App token
- Salesforce: OAuth 2.0 (Connected App)

**Identity**: `crm_users.email` — internal salespeople resolved to canonical `person_id` via Identity Manager. `crm_contacts.email` is for external customers and is **not** resolved to `person_id`.

**Why multi-source design**: Organizations may use HubSpot and Salesforce simultaneously (e.g. different business units) or migrate between them. This unified schema enables:
- Single query across all CRM sources for sales performance analytics
- Consistent identity resolution: `owner_id` → `crm_users.email` → `person_id`
- Simplified Silver/Gold transformation regardless of CRM vendor

**Terminology mapping**:

| Concept | HubSpot | Salesforce | Unified |
|---------|---------|------------|---------|
| Internal user | Owner | User | `crm_users` |
| Deal | Deal | Opportunity | `crm_deals` |
| Activity | Engagement (call/meeting/task/email) | Task + Event | `crm_activities` |
| External person | Contact | Contact | `crm_contacts` |
| Company | Company | Account | `crm_accounts` |

---

## Silver Tables — Step 1: Unified Schema (pre-Identity Resolution)

> **Silver Step 1**: Data from source-specific Bronze tables ([hubspot.md](hubspot.md) and [salesforce.md](salesforce.md)) is normalized and written here. No `person_id` yet — Identity Resolution runs in Step 2.

### `crm_users` — Internal salesperson directory

Identity anchor for all CRM analytics. Maps to `person_id` via Identity Manager.

| Field | Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `user_id` | String | REQUIRED | Source-specific user ID (`owner.id` in HubSpot, `User.Id` 18-char in Salesforce) |
| `email` | String | REQUIRED | Email — primary identity key → `person_id` |
| `first_name` | String | NULLABLE | First name |
| `last_name` | String | NULLABLE | Last name |
| `title` | String | NULLABLE | Job title |
| `department` | String | NULLABLE | Department (Salesforce only; NULL for HubSpot) |
| `is_active` | Int64 | REQUIRED | 1 if active, 0 if deactivated / archived |
| `metadata` | String | REQUIRED | Full API response as JSON |
| `collected_at` | DateTime64(3) | REQUIRED | Collection timestamp |

## Source Mapping

> Per-source Bronze schemas (raw connector output) are defined in [hubspot.md](hubspot.md) and [salesforce.md](salesforce.md). The tables below describe how those Bronze records are normalized into Silver Step 1 unified tables.

### HubSpot

| Unified table | HubSpot source | Key mapping notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `crm_users` | `GET /crm/v3/owners` | `id` → `user_id`; `archived` → `is_active = 0` |
| `crm_deals` | `GET /crm/v3/objects/deals` | `hubspot_owner_id` → `owner_id`; `dealstage` → `stage`; `is_won`/`is_closed` derived from pipeline settings |
| `crm_activities` | `GET /crm/v3/objects/calls` + `/meetings` + `/tasks` + `/emails` + `/notes` | `hs_timestamp` → `timestamp`; `hs_call_duration` (ms) ÷ 1000 → `duration_seconds`; disposition GUID resolved to label → `outcome` |
| `crm_contacts` | `GET /crm/v3/objects/contacts` | `hubspot_owner_id` → `owner_id`; company association via Associations API |
| `crm_accounts` | `GET /crm/v3/objects/companies` | `domain` → `domain`; no parent hierarchy in HubSpot |

### Salesforce

| Unified table | Salesforce source | Key mapping notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `crm_users` | `SELECT ... FROM User` | `Id` → `user_id`; `Profile.Name` → metadata; `IsActive` → `is_active` |
| `crm_deals` | `SELECT ... FROM Opportunity` | `OwnerId` → `owner_id`; `StageName` → `stage`; `IsClosed`/`IsWon` native → `is_closed`/`is_won` |
| `crm_activities` | `SELECT ... FROM Task` + `SELECT ... FROM Event` | Task: `ActivityDate` → `timestamp`; `CallDurationInSeconds` → `duration_seconds`. Event: `StartDateTime` → `timestamp`; `DurationInMinutes` × 60 → `duration_seconds` |
| `crm_contacts` | `SELECT ... FROM Contact` | `AccountId` → `account_id`; `OwnerId` → `owner_id` |
| `crm_accounts` | `SELECT ... FROM Account` | `Website` → `domain`; `ParentId` → `parent_account_id` |

---

## Identity Resolution

**Identity anchor**: `crm_users` — internal salespeople only.

**Resolution process**:
1. Extract `email` from `crm_users`
2. Normalize (lowercase, trim)
3. Map to canonical `person_id` via Identity Manager in Silver step 2
4. Propagate `person_id` to `crm_deals` and `crm_activities` via `owner_id` join

**`crm_contacts.email`** — external customers, **not** resolved to `person_id`. Treated as CRM reference data.

**Cross-source matching**: same salesperson may exist in both HubSpot and Salesforce if the organization uses both. Email-based resolution ensures they map to a single `person_id`.

---

## Silver Step 2 → Gold

Silver Step 1 (`crm_*`) feeds into Silver Step 2 (`class_*`) after Identity Resolution adds `person_id`.

| Silver Step 1 table | Silver Step 2 target | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| `crm_users` | Identity Manager (`email` → `person_id`) | Used for identity resolution |
| `crm_deals` | `class_crm_deals` | Planned — unified deal pipeline stream |
| `crm_activities` | `class_crm_activities` | Planned — unified activity stream |
| `crm_contacts` | *(reference only)* | No Silver Step 2 target — used to enrich deal/activity context |
| `crm_accounts` | *(reference only)* | No Silver Step 2 target — used for grouping by company |

**Planned Silver Step 2 streams**:
- `class_crm_deals`: deduplicated deals with resolved `person_id`, normalised `is_won`/`is_closed`, stage category
- `class_crm_activities`: unified activities with resolved `person_id`, normalised `duration_seconds`, human-readable `outcome`

**Gold metrics**:

*Pipeline analytics* (from `crm_deals`):
- Per salesperson: deal count, total deal value, win rate, average deal cycle time
- Pipeline health: open deals by stage, weighted pipeline value

*Sales activity analytics* (from `crm_activities`):
- Activity volume per rep per week: calls made, emails sent, meetings booked, tasks completed
- Activity mix: ratio of calls vs emails vs meetings per rep (prospecting pattern analysis)
- Outcome rate: completed activities vs total activities (effectiveness signal)
- Workload: activity distribution and balance across team members

> **Note on `crm_activities` as the productivity signal**: Sales activity metrics are the primary productivity measure for sales roles — analogous to commit count for engineers. Unlike deal metrics (which lag by weeks or months), activity counts are a real-time signal of daily effort. The `crm_activities` table maps from HubSpot Engagements API (`/crm/v3/objects/calls`, `/meetings`, `/tasks`, `/emails`) and Salesforce Activity objects (`Task` + `Event`). Both sources are already covered in the Bronze schema above.

## Open Questions

### OQ-CRM-1: `is_won` / `is_closed` derivation for HubSpot

HubSpot does not expose `is_won` / `is_closed` as deal properties. Derivation requires:
1. Fetching pipeline settings: `GET /crm/v3/pipelines/deals`
2. For each stage: checking `metadata.isClosed` and `metadata.probability` (100 = won, 0 = lost)

**Question**: Should derivation happen at Bronze collection time (store computed values) or in Silver transformation (store raw `stage` only in Bronze)?

**Current approach**: Store raw `stage` in Bronze, derive `is_won`/`is_closed` in Silver using pipeline settings cached separately.

---

### OQ-CRM-2: Activity duration normalisation

Duration units differ across sources and activity types:
- HubSpot calls: milliseconds
- HubSpot meetings: start/end timestamps (calculate difference)
- Salesforce Events: minutes
- Salesforce Tasks (calls): seconds

**Question**: Should normalisation to seconds happen at Bronze collection time or in Silver?

**Current approach**: Normalise to seconds at collection time, store in `duration_seconds`. Raw value preserved in `metadata`.

---

### OQ-CRM-3: Stage normalisation across sources

HubSpot deal stages are portal-specific internal names (e.g. `appointmentscheduled`, `closedwon`). Salesforce uses more standardised names (`Prospecting`, `Closed Won`). There is no universal stage taxonomy.

**Question**: Should `class_crm_deals` normalise stages to a common set (e.g. `open` / `won` / `lost`) or preserve source-specific values?

**Current approach**: Preserve raw stage in Bronze. In Silver, derive binary `is_won`/`is_closed` — sufficient for most analytics. Full stage funnel analysis remains source-specific.
