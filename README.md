## What Is Insight

Insight collects events and metrics from the tools teams already use — version control, task trackers, communication platforms, AI coding assistants, HR systems, and more — and unifies them into a single, identity-resolved data model.

**Primary use cases:**

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Process performance** | Cycle time, PR throughput, deployment frequency, task flow |
| **Productivity analytics** | Developer output, AI tool adoption, collaboration patterns |
| **Bottleneck detection** | Where work gets stuck across the delivery pipeline |
| **Team health** | Meeting load, async/sync balance, focus time |
| **Performance review** | Individual and team contribution signals across tools |
| **AI adoption tracking** | Usage, model distribution, and ROI across AI tools |

Insight is **not** a replacement for source systems — it reads from them, resolves identities, and provides a governed analytics layer on top.

## Architecture Overview

The solution consists of five main components:

### Components

| # | Component | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Connectors** | Source-specific integrations that pull raw data from external tools (git, task trackers, AI tools, HR systems, etc.) and write it to Bronze tables in the analytics database. |
| 2 | **Connector Orchestration** | Scheduling, retry, state management, and monitoring layer that coordinates connector runs and ensures reliable data ingestion. |
| 3 | **Database** | Analytics store holding the Bronze → Silver → Gold pipeline. Bronze is raw source data; Silver unifies schemas and resolves identities; Gold contains aggregated business metrics. |
| 4 | **Backend** | REST API server providing authentication, authorization, user management, and data proxy services. Serves as the central authentication gateway and data access layer, integrating with enterprise SSO systems. |
| 5 | **Frontend** | Single-page application (SPA) providing engineering managers, team leads, and developers with analytics and visualizations of git activity, AI tool adoption, pull request metrics, and team productivity. |

### Bronze → Silver → Gold pipeline

- **Bronze** — Raw, source-faithful tables. Field names and types preserved from the API. One table per entity type per source.
- **Silver Step 1** — Source tables unified into common schemas (e.g. `collab_chat_activity` merges Slack + Zulip + M365 Teams).
- **Silver Step 2** — Identity resolution: `email` / `login` / `user_id` resolved to canonical `person_id` via the Identity Manager.
- **Gold** — Aggregated, business-level metrics (cycle time, throughput, adoption rates, etc.).

## Key Concepts

**Identity Resolution** — Every Bronze table carries a source-native user identifier (`email`, `login`, `uuid`, etc.). The Identity Manager resolves these to a stable `person_id` in Silver Step 2, enabling cross-source analytics (e.g. joining a developer's git activity with their task tracker throughput and AI tool usage).

**Connector spec** — Each connector defines its Bronze table schemas, identity fields, Silver/Gold target streams, and open questions. The `{source}.md` file is the full technical spec; `specs/PRD.md` captures the code-agnostic requirements.

**Extendability** — Adding a new data source means: (1) defining Bronze tables, (2) mapping identity fields, (3) routing to an existing or new Silver stream. The architecture is designed to accommodate new connectors without changes to existing pipelines.

---

## Working with This Repo

- **Browse specs** — Start at [`docs/connectors/README.md`](docs/connectors/README.md) for the connector index, or [`docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md`](docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md) for the master Bronze schema reference.
- **Add a connector** — Follow the layout in any existing `docs/connectors/{domain}/{source}/` directory. Use `specs/PRD.md` for requirements and `specs/DESIGN.md` for table schemas and pipeline mappings.
- **Cypilot** — Run `cypilot on` in a supported AI agent to activate assisted spec authoring, validation, and traceability. Cypilot is sourced from [github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot](https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot).
- **Inbox** — Documents in `inbox/` are drafts awaiting review. Do not reference them as canonical sources.

---

## Working with `docs/`

The `docs/` folder is the single source of truth for all product and connector specifications. Every document here is considered canonical and must go through a review process before being merged.

### Document types

Each component or connector has a `specs/` subdirectory with three document types:

| File | Purpose | Who writes it |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `specs/PRD.md` | Business and product requirements — actors, use cases, functional requirements, NFRs. **Code-agnostic**: no schemas, no implementation details. | Product / domain owners |
| `specs/DESIGN.md` | Technical design — Bronze table schemas, identity resolution mechanics, Silver/Gold pipeline mappings, data flow. | Engineering |
| `specs/ADR/` | Architecture Decision Records — individual decisions that affect the design. | Engineering |

### Contribution workflow

#### Adding or updating requirements (PRD)

Business requirements, use cases, actor definitions, and functional/non-functional requirements belong in `specs/PRD.md` of the relevant component or connector.

1. Create a branch.
2. Edit `specs/PRD.md` — add or update requirements. Keep it code-agnostic: describe **what** the system must do, not how.
3. Open a PR for review. Once approved, merge.

#### Updating the technical design (DESIGN)

`specs/DESIGN.md` is the authoritative technical specification for a component. It must reflect the current agreed-upon design at all times.

**Minor changes** (style fixes, formatting, clarifications, small field additions) can be committed directly to `specs/DESIGN.md` via a standard PR.

**Major changes** (data schema changes, new pipeline stages, significant architectural decisions, breaking changes to existing models) require an ADR first:

1. Create a new ADR in `specs/ADR/` describing the proposed change (context, options considered, decision, consequences).
2. Open a PR with the ADR only.
3. Once the ADR is approved and merged, update `specs/DESIGN.md` in a follow-up commit or PR to reflect the accepted decision.

This ensures every significant design change has a traceable decision record before the canonical design document is updated.

#### ADR naming convention

```
specs/ADR/NNN-short-description.md
```

Example: `specs/ADR/001-use-email-as-identity-key.md`

### Summary

```
Propose requirement change       →  edit PRD.md       →  PR  →  merge
Propose minor design change      →  edit DESIGN.md    →  PR  →  merge
Propose major design change      →  new ADR           →  PR  →  merge  →  update DESIGN.md
```
