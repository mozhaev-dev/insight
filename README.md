# Insight

> Decision Intelligence Platform

**Insight** is an extensible platform that collects operational data from across an organisation's toolchain, resolves all activity to unified person identities, and delivers actionable analytics for productivity improvement, bottleneck detection, process performance tracking, and team health reviews.

This repository is the **monorepo** for the Insight product. It contains:
- **`src/`** — source code for all platform components
- **`docs/`** — canonical product and technical specifications (specs, designs, ADRs)

## What Is Insight

Insight collects events and metrics from the tools teams already use — version control, task trackers, communication platforms, AI coding assistants, HR systems, and more — and unifies them into a single, identity-resolved data model.

**Primary use cases:**

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Process performance** | Cycle time, PR throughput, deployment frequency, task flow |
| **Productivity analytics** | Developer output, AI tool adoption, collaboration patterns |
| **Bottleneck detection** | Where work gets stuck across the delivery pipeline |
| **Team health** | Meeting load, async/sync balance, focus time |
| **Performance review** | Individual and team contribution signals across tools |
| **AI adoption tracking** | Usage, model distribution, and ROI across AI tools |

Insight is **not** a replacement for source systems — it reads from them, resolves identities, and provides a governed analytics layer on top.

## Architecture Overview

The solution consists of five main components:

### Components

| # | Component | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Connectors** | Source-specific integrations that pull raw data from external tools (git, task trackers, AI tools, HR systems, etc.) and write it to Bronze tables in the analytics database. |
| 2 | **Connector Orchestration** | Scheduling, retry, state management, and monitoring layer that coordinates connector runs and ensures reliable data ingestion. |
| 3 | **Database** | Analytics store holding the Bronze → Silver → Gold pipeline. Bronze is raw source data; Silver unifies schemas and resolves identities; Gold contains aggregated business metrics. |
| 4 | **Backend** | REST API server providing authentication, authorization, user management, and data proxy services. Serves as the central authentication gateway and data access layer, integrating with enterprise SSO systems. |
| 5 | **Frontend** | Single-page application (SPA) providing engineering managers, team leads, and developers with analytics and visualizations of git activity, AI tool adoption, pull request metrics, and team productivity. |

### Bronze → Silver → Gold pipeline

- **Bronze** — Raw, source-faithful tables. Field names and types preserved from the API. One table per entity type per source.
- **Silver Step 1** — Source tables unified into common schemas (e.g. `collab_chat_activity` merges Slack + Zulip + M365 Teams).
- **Silver Step 2** — Identity resolution: `email` / `login` / `user_id` resolved to canonical `person_id` via the Identity Manager.
- **Gold** — Aggregated, business-level metrics (cycle time, throughput, adoption rates, etc.).

## Key Concepts

**Identity Resolution** — Every Bronze table carries a source-native user identifier (`email`, `login`, `uuid`, etc.). The Identity Manager resolves these to a stable `person_id` in Silver Step 2, enabling cross-source analytics (e.g. joining a developer's git activity with their task tracker throughput and AI tool usage).

**Connector spec** — Each connector defines its Bronze table schemas, identity fields, Silver/Gold target streams, and open questions. The `{source}.md` file is the full technical spec; `specs/PRD.md` captures the code-agnostic requirements.

**Extendability** — Adding a new data source means: (1) defining Bronze tables, (2) mapping identity fields, (3) routing to an existing or new Silver stream. The architecture is designed to accommodate new connectors without changes to existing pipelines.

---

## Working with This Repo

- **Browse specs** — Start at [`docs/components/connectors/README.md`](docs/components/connectors/README.md) for the connector index, or [`docs/domain/`](docs/domain/) for cross-cutting platform concepts (identity resolution, connector framework).
- **Understand a domain** — Read the relevant `docs/domain/{domain}/specs/DESIGN.md` first. These documents describe the platform's core algorithms, data contracts, and architectural decisions that span multiple components.
- **Add a connector** — Follow the layout in any existing `docs/components/connectors/{domain}/{source}/` directory. Use `specs/PRD.md` for requirements and `specs/DESIGN.md` for table schemas and pipeline mappings.
- **Add source code** — Place code under `src/{component}/`. The structure mirrors `docs/components/` — `src/connectors/`, `src/backend/`, `src/frontend/`, `src/orchestrator/`.
- **Cypilot** — Run `cypilot on` in a supported AI agent to activate assisted spec authoring, validation, and traceability. Cypilot is sourced from [github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot](https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot).
- **Inbox** — Documents in `inbox/` are drafts awaiting review. Do not reference them as canonical sources.

## Working with `docs/`

The `docs/` folder is the single source of truth for all product specifications, architectural decisions, and technical designs. Every document here is considered canonical and must go through a review process before being merged.

`docs/` describes the **architecture and intent** of the platform. The corresponding implementation lives in `src/`. When adding or changing source code, the relevant spec in `docs/components/{component}/specs/DESIGN.md` should be updated in the same PR (or a follow-up ADR opened if it's a significant design change).

### Document types

Each component or connector has a `specs/` subdirectory with three document types:

| File | Purpose | Who writes it |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `specs/PRD.md` | Business and product requirements — actors, use cases, functional requirements, NFRs. **Code-agnostic**: no schemas, no implementation details. | Product / domain owners |
| `specs/DESIGN.md` | Technical design — Bronze table schemas, identity resolution mechanics, Silver/Gold pipeline mappings, data flow. | Engineering |
| `specs/ADR/` | Architecture Decision Records — individual decisions that affect the design. | Engineering |

### Contribution workflow

#### Adding or updating requirements (PRD)

Business requirements, use cases, actor definitions, and functional/non-functional requirements belong in `specs/PRD.md` of the relevant component or connector.

1. Create a branch.
2. Edit `specs/PRD.md` — add or update requirements. Keep it code-agnostic: describe **what** the system must do, not how.
3. Open a PR for review. Once approved, merge.

#### Updating the technical design (DESIGN)

`specs/DESIGN.md` is the authoritative technical specification for a component. It must reflect the current agreed-upon design at all times.

**Minor changes** (style fixes, formatting, clarifications, small field additions) can be committed directly to `specs/DESIGN.md` via a standard PR.

**Major changes** (data schema changes, new pipeline stages, significant architectural decisions, breaking changes to existing models) require an ADR first:

1. Create a new ADR in `specs/ADR/` describing the proposed change (context, options considered, decision, consequences).
2. Open a PR with the ADR only.
3. Once the ADR is approved and merged, update `specs/DESIGN.md` in a follow-up commit or PR to reflect the accepted decision.

This ensures every significant design change has a traceable decision record before the canonical design document is updated.

#### ADR naming convention

```
specs/ADR/NNN-short-description.md
```

Example: `specs/ADR/001-use-email-as-identity-key.md`

### Summary

```
Propose requirement change       →  edit PRD.md       →  PR  →  merge
Propose minor design change      →  edit DESIGN.md    →  PR  →  merge
Propose major design change      →  new ADR           →  PR  →  merge  →  update DESIGN.md
```
