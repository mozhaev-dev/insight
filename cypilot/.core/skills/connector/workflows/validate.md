# Validate Connector

Checks that a connector package meets all requirements from the connector spec.

## Checklist

Read connector package files and verify each item:

### Structure
- [ ] `connector.yaml` exists (nocode) or `Dockerfile` + `source_<name>/source.py` exists (CDK)
- [ ] `descriptor.yaml` exists with required fields (name, version, type, schedule, workflow, dbt_select, connection.namespace)
- [ ] K8s Secret example in `secrets/connectors/<name>.yaml.example` with `insight_source_id` annotation
- [ ] `dbt/` directory with at least one .sql model and schema.yml

### Manifest (nocode)
- [ ] `version: 7.0.4` or compatible
- [ ] `type: DeclarativeSource`
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_tenant_id` as required
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields use prefixes (insight_*, azure_*, github_*, etc.)
- [ ] No bare `tenant_id` or `client_id` in config fields
- [ ] AddFields includes `tenant_id` from `config['insight_tenant_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `source_id` from `config['insight_source_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `unique_key` with pattern: `{tenant_id}-{source_id}-{natural_key}`
- [ ] InlineSchemaLoader has `additionalProperties: true`
- [ ] Schema includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key` as string fields
- [ ] Nullable types used only where API actually returns null (not all fields)

### CDK (Python)
- [ ] `parse_response()` injects `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] `unique_key` includes `tenant_id` and `source_id`
- [ ] `spec.json` has `insight_tenant_id` and `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields in `spec.json` use source-specific prefixes (`insight_*`, `github_*`, `jira_*`, etc.)
- [ ] No bare field names (`token`, `client_id`, `tenant_id`, `start_date`, etc.) in `connectionSpecification.properties`

### Descriptor
- [ ] `name` matches directory name
- [ ] `connection.namespace` = `bronze_<name>`
- [ ] `dbt_select` includes connector tag with `+` suffix (e.g., `tag:m365+`)
- [ ] `schedule` is valid cron expression
- [ ] `workflow` field is present
- [ ] No `streams` block (streams are owned by Airbyte connector, discovered via `airbyte discover`)
- [ ] No `silver_targets` block (Silver targets are determined by dbt model tags via `dbt_select`)

### dbt Models
- [ ] Model name follows `<connector>__<domain>.sql` pattern
- [ ] `materialized='incremental'`
- [ ] `schema='staging'`
- [ ] Tags include connector name and `silver:class_<domain>`
- [ ] SELECT includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] Uses `{{ source('bronze_<name>', '<stream>') }}`
- [ ] Has `{% if is_incremental() %}` block

### dbt schema.yml
- [ ] Source defined with `schema: bronze_<name>`
- [ ] Model has `tenant_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `source_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `unique_key` with not_null and unique tests

### Credentials Template
- [ ] `credentials.yaml.example` lists all required fields
- [ ] `insight_source_id` is included
- [ ] No real credentials in any tracked file
