-- Dedup bronze_slack.users_details to one row per Slack user.
-- Identity is (tenant_id, source_id, user_id) so email changes register as
-- attribute updates in the downstream SCD2 snapshot, not as new entities.
-- Bronze has one row per user per day; we keep the latest `date` seen and
-- drop rows with null/empty email.
