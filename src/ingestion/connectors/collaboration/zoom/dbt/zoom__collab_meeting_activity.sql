-- Materialized as a view (not incremental) because:
--   1. The session-stitching CTE chain (issue #258) needs visibility into
--      the full meeting history per Zoom Meeting ID to correctly assign
--      cluster_idx — an incremental window over participants would cluster
--      against an outdated meetings snapshot and miss-stitch edge cases at
--      the window boundary.
--   2. dbt-clickhouse incremental materialization does not currently
--      support top-level WITH clauses (the wrapped SQL produces
--      "Unmatched parentheses" at compile time).
-- The downstream Silver model class_collab_meeting_activity is itself
-- incremental on _version, so view recomputation cost is bounded.

-- Zoom meeting activity aggregated per user per day.
--
-- Grain: (tenant, source, email, date). We intentionally filter out participants
-- without an email (guests / anonymous joiners) because:
--   1. Without a stable user identifier, a COALESCE(email, user_name) key is
--      unstable — the same person can flip keys between batches depending on
--      whether Zoom returns their email that run.
--   2. Anonymous participants can't be joined to identity at the Silver layer
--      anyway, so they add noise without enabling any downstream use case.
-- If Zoom ever starts exposing a stable participant_id/user_id, switch to that.
--
-- Meeting-session stitching (issue #258):
-- Zoom assigns a NEW `uuid` to every meeting session, but the numeric `id`
-- (Zoom Meeting ID) is reused — both for legitimate recurring meetings AND
-- when the host disconnects and reconnects (host drop, network blip, etc).
-- A naive `count(*)` over participant rows therefore over-reports
-- `meetings_attended` whenever a host drops off, since each user gets one
-- participant row per session of the same logical meeting.
--
-- We stitch sessions sharing the same `(tenant, source, id)` whose
-- end-of-prev → start-of-next gap is ≤ `session_gap_seconds` (5 min) into
-- a single `logical_meeting_id`. Recurring meetings that legitimately reuse
-- an `id` end up in different clusters because their gaps are hours/days,
-- not minutes. `meetings_attended` then counts distinct logical meetings
-- per user per day instead of distinct participant rows.
--
-- Threshold choice (300 s / 5 min): observed host-drop rejoin gaps in
-- production are 11–147 s. 300 s provides a safety margin while keeping
-- the window well below the ≥ 5-min buffer typically inserted between
-- separate back-to-back meetings on the same PMI. Back-to-back PMI
-- sessions with < 5-min gap between them will still be merged — this is a
-- known trade-off documented in issue #258. If the organisation consistently
-- schedules back-to-back calls with < 5-min transitions, lower this value.
--
-- Durations (`audio_duration_seconds`, `video_duration_seconds`,
-- `screen_share_duration_seconds`) are NOT affected — they sum real
-- per-participant join/leave intervals, which are correct to add across
-- split sessions (the user really was in-call during both halves).
