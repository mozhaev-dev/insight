-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Confluence page versions → class_wiki_activity
--
-- Per-user per-day edit activity rolled up from wiki_page_versions. One row
-- per (tenant, source, author, day) with counts of pages edited, total edits
-- (sessions, see below), pages created (version_number = 1), major edits,
-- minor edits.
--
-- Edit-session collapse (issue #259):
-- Confluence creates a new wiki_page_versions row on every save — autosaves,
-- rapid republishes, plugin-driven saves, etc. Counting raw versions
-- systematically overstates editing activity (e.g., 27 versions for a
-- single 8-hour session of editing one page). To recover "logical edit",
-- we group consecutive versions of the same (tenant, source, page, author)
-- into sessions: a new session starts when the gap to the previous version
-- of the same key exceeds `session_gap_seconds` (default 30 min). The
-- threshold is conservative — long enough to absorb autosave bursts and
-- short coffee breaks, short enough to keep a "morning vs evening" split.
-- `total_edits` then counts distinct (page, session) pairs instead of raw
-- versions. `pages_edited` and `pages_created` are unaffected by the bug
-- and stay as before.
--
-- Identity resolution: same pattern as confluence__wiki_pages — LEFT JOIN
-- with bronze_jira.jira_user on accountId. Skipped at compile-time if Jira
-- is not provisioned; author_email falls back to NULL.
--
-- Scaling note: materialized as view, which recomputes the versions → agg
-- pipeline on every downstream query. Fine for MVP (tens of thousands of
-- versions). Promote to materialized='incremental' keyed on (author_id, day)
-- once wiki_page_versions grows past ~1M rows or Gold query latency rises.
