-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Cursor per-user per-day usage → class_ai_dev_usage
--
-- Source: bronze_cursor.cursor_daily_usage — daily aggregate stream from
-- POST /teams/daily-usage-data. One row per (userId, date) when the user was
-- active that day (isActive=true).
--
-- Filter: isActive=true AND email IS NOT NULL AND trim(email)!=''.
--
-- session_count semantics: Cursor does not expose a per-day "session count" —
-- it exposes chat/composer/agent request counters instead. For class_ai_dev_usage
-- we set session_count=1 per active day, which matches the concept of
-- "a day the user used the tool". Alternative counters (chatRequests,
-- agentRequests, totalTabsAccepted) are carried through as dedicated columns.
--
-- Note: the previous implementation of this model read cursor_usage_events* and
-- produced per-event rows with token granularity. It was replaced with a per-day
-- aggregation because class_ai_dev_usage consumers expect (tenant, email, day,
-- tool) granularity. Per-event / token-level data remains in Bronze and can be
-- tapped by a separate staging model if ever needed.
