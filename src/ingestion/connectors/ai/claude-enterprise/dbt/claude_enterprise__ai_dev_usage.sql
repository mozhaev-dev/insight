-- Bronze → Silver: Claude Enterprise per-user per-day Code activity.
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_enterprise.claude_enterprise_users — daily per-user
-- snapshot of Claude Enterprise usage including code_* fields.
--
-- Strategy: Enterprise is the canonical source for Claude Code activity
-- (lines_added, sessions, tool_accepted/rejected) for orgs on the Enterprise
-- subscription. Claude Admin's claude_admin_code_usage is no longer tagged
-- for silver:class_ai_dev_usage — Enterprise covers the same activity at
-- the user-day grain plus additional dimensions (chat, cowork, office) that
-- Admin doesn't expose. Admin remains tagged for silver:class_ai_api_usage
-- (token-level metrics that Enterprise doesn't publish).
--
-- Fundamental gap: Enterprise reports `code_lines_added` (AI-accepted lines)
-- but does not expose `total_lines_added` (every keystroke including manual
-- edits). This is the same limitation every assistant-mode AI coder has —
-- Cursor exposes both because it sees keystrokes; Claude Code only sees its
-- own suggestions. Downstream metrics that need a denominator (e.g.,
-- `ai_loc_share_pct = accepted/total`) emit NULL for Enterprise rows; that
-- metric is Cursor-only by design.
--
-- Ingestion shape:
--   • One row per (user_id, date). claude_enterprise_users is a daily
--     snapshot, so we treat it as already aggregated at the (email, day)
--     grain. No SUM/argMax wrapping needed.
--   • Filter: code_session_count > 0 OR code_lines_added > 0
--                                       OR code_tool_accepted_count > 0
--     drop rows where the user had Enterprise activity but no Code activity
--     that day (avoids polluting class_ai_dev_usage with empty Code rows).
--     The third condition catches tool-only days where the user accepted
--     Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit tool calls without a session/lines
--     event being attributed.
