-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Claude Enterprise engagement → class_ai_api_usage
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_enterprise.claude_enterprise_users — per-user per-day
-- engagement metrics from /v1/organizations/analytics/users. Each Bronze row
-- carries metrics for four surfaces: chat (web), claude_code, office, cowork.
--
-- Surface split:
--   • channel='web'     ← chat_* fields (chat_conversation_count, chat_message_count)
--   • channel='office'  ← office_* fields (excel + powerpoint sessions/messages)
--   • channel='cowork'  ← cowork_* fields (cowork sessions/messages)
--   • code_* fields     ← NOT emitted. Claude Code usage comes from claude-admin
--                         only (lead's rule: shared capability, single source).
--
-- Each Bronze row can produce up to 3 staging rows (one per non-empty channel).
-- A channel is "non-empty" if its primary counter (conversations for web,
-- sessions for office/cowork) is > 0.
--
-- email is sourced from user_email (lowercased, trimmed). Enterprise Analytics
-- API always provides user_email for this stream (unlike the Admin API's
-- messages_usage, which is attributable only to api_key_id / workspace_id).
--
-- Note: this model has never been run end-to-end against live Enterprise data
-- (as of 2026-04). It is written against the spec; real-data validation will
-- happen once the tenant onboards an Enterprise Analytics API key. Column
-- extraction logic mirrors the transformations in claude-enterprise/connector.yaml.
