-- Bronze → Silver: Claude Enterprise per-user per-day assistant surface usage.
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_enterprise.claude_enterprise_users — per-user daily metrics.
-- Each Bronze row can produce up to 5 staging rows (one per non-empty surface).
--
-- Surface mapping:
--   surface='chat'       ← chat_* fields (conversations, messages, projects, files, skills, etc.)
--   surface='excel'      ← excel_* fields
--   surface='powerpoint' ← powerpoint_* fields
--   surface='cowork'     ← cowork_* fields (sessions, messages, actions, skills, dispatch turns)
--   surface='cross'      ← web_search_count (cross-surface counter, not attributable to a single product)
--
-- All rows carry tool='claude' (vendor discriminator for class_ai_assistant_usage).
-- Future: tool='chatgpt' for OpenAI Compliance API, tool='gemini' for Google.
--
-- Previously this data fed class_ai_api_usage via the now-deprecated
-- claude_enterprise__ai_api_usage model. Enterprise engagement data represents
-- human ↔ Claude assistant interaction (not programmatic API consumption), so it
-- belongs in class_ai_assistant_usage instead.
