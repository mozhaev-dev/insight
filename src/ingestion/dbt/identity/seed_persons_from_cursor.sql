-- Phase 1 (Initial Seed): Cursor members → person.persons
-- One-time seed. Creates person records from Cursor Bronze data.
-- Idempotent: skips cursor members whose email already exists in persons.
-- Source: docs/domain/identity-resolution/specs/DECOMPOSITION.md §2.1
--
-- Prerequisite: person.persons table created by scripts/migrations/20260408000000_init-identity.sql
-- Run: dbt run --select seed_persons_from_cursor
