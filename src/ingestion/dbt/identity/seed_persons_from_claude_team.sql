-- Phase 1 (Initial Seed): Claude Team users → person.persons
-- Idempotent: skips users whose email already exists in persons.
-- Dedup: takes latest row per email by _airbyte_extracted_at.
-- Source: docs/domain/identity-resolution/specs/DECOMPOSITION.md §2.1
--
-- Prerequisite: person.persons table created by scripts/migrations/20260408000000_init-identity.sql
-- Run: dbt run --select seed_persons_from_claude_team
--
-- Test manually: http://localhost:30123/play  (user: default, password: clickhouse_local)
--   or:          http://localhost:8123/play
