-- Emit NULL (not hardcoded 0) for KPI columns whose source data isn't
-- ingested yet. Lets the FE render a ComingSoon placeholder for "unknown"
-- instead of displaying a fake zero that looks like a real measurement.
--
-- Depends on 20260422000000_gold-views.sql (insight.ic_kpis and
-- insight.ic_chart_delivery already exist).
--
-- Columns made Nullable and set to NULL:
--   insight.ic_kpis.loc               — real git-LOC needs Bitbucket diffstat
--                                       (not in bronze_bitbucket_cloud.commits yet).
--                                       Previously sourced from Cursor's
--                                       totalLinesAdded, which is IDE-typed
--                                       activity, not committed code.
--   insight.ic_kpis.prs_merged        — Bitbucket PR ingestion not landed.
--   insight.ic_kpis.pr_cycle_time_h   — same.
--   insight.ic_chart_delivery.prs_merged — same.
--
-- When a real source lands, just flip the column expression back to its
-- real aggregate — the column type (Nullable) already accommodates both.
