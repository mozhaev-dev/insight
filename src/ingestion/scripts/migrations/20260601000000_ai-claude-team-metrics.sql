-- ai_bullet_rows — Claude Team metric extension (INSIGHT-458)
-- =====================================================================
--
-- Extends Branch 3 (tool = 'claude_code') of ai_bullet_rows with three
-- new metric_keys sourced exclusively from Claude Team:
--
--   cc_cost        ← silver.class_ai_dev_usage.cost_cents
--                    Per-user-per-day cost in cents. Claude Team is the
--                    only source at this grain (all others expose cost at
--                    org/workspace level only). NULL for cursor /
--                    claude_enterprise / claude_admin rows → 0 via
--                    COALESCE; query_ref sums it and exposes as
--                    cc_cost metric.
--
--   prs_with_cc    ← silver.class_ai_dev_usage.prs_with_cc_count
--                    PRs where Claude Code was active at least once.
--                    Populated only on tenants with the Anthropic
--                    GitHub-app connected; structural 0 on orgs without
--                    it (including Constructor Tech dev org). NULL for
--                    all other sources → 0 via COALESCE.
--
--   prs_total      ← silver.class_ai_dev_usage.prs_total_count
--                    Total PRs in the measurement window; denominator
--                    for a future prs_with_cc_pct ratio metric.
--                    Same availability caveat as prs_with_cc.
--
-- Shape change: Branch 3 grows from 5 to 8 metric_keys emitted per
-- (person, date) row via ARRAY JOIN. Branches 1 and 2 are unchanged.
--
-- Paired backend migration: m2026XXXX_ai_claude_team_metrics.rs updates
-- the query_ref for Team Bullet AI and IC Bullet AI to read the three
-- new metric_keys via sumIf and expose them in the response.
--
-- Idempotent: DROP VIEW IF EXISTS + CREATE VIEW.
