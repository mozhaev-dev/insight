//! `MariaDB` connection.
//!
//! **Self-managed `SeaORM` pool — we deliberately do NOT use the toolkit `db`
//! capability** (same as the analytics gear). The identity queries need SQL that
//! `cf-gears-toolkit-db` (v0.8.4) can neither express via its scoped
//! entity-builder nor run as raw SQL (it intentionally exposes no raw-SQL path —
//! `DbConn`/`DbTx` are builder-only). Specifically:
//!   * window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()` / `LEAD() OVER (…)`) — the resolver reads
//!     and the SCD2 `account_person_map` / `org_chart` rebuilds;
//!   * `WITH RECURSIVE` — the org-subchart / visibility traversals;
//!   * atomic conditional DML with a correlated subquery — the role in-use and
//!     last-admin lockout guards.
//!
//! See constructorfabric/gears-rust#4239 for the capability request.
//!
//! All SQL here is **verbatim from the .NET service** (cutover parity). It is
//! injection-safe despite being raw: every value is a **bound parameter**
//! (`Statement::from_sql_and_values`, no string interpolation) and the tenant is
//! always pinned in the `WHERE`. The `identity` database schema is owned by THIS
//! service's migrator — see the ownership-transfer docs in `crate::migration`.
